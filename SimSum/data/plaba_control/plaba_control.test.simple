Knee osteoarthritis is a common disease, often occuring with Baker's cyst (a fluid-filled pocket behind the knee). Besides osteoarthritis, other knee joint diseases can lead to an uncomfortable fuild-filled swelling behind the knee. Radiation therapy treats osteoarthritis, with an anti-inflammatory effect. As excess fluid in joints is linked with joint inflammation, radiation therapy may help fluid production in joints and reduce the size of the fluid-filled swelling behind the knee. Our trial includes 29 knees receiving radiation therapy for knee arthritis. Besides knee pain and function measurements, the size of the cust was measured for a short- (6 to 12 weeks) and long-term (9 to 12 months) follow-up. Low-dose radiation therapy improves measurements for knee arthritis. The size of the fluid-filled swelling behind the knees decreased. 75% of patients in the short-term and 79% of patients in the long-term achieved a decrease in size of over 25% relative to baseline scores. Radiation therapy of knee osteoarthritis decreases the size of a Baker's cyst. Most patients respond to the treatment. Whether radiation therapy treats Baker's cyst without associated osteoarthritis is unknown.
Osteoarthritis of the knee is a common disease, often associated with Baker's cyst, which is an abnormal enlargement of the bursa (a protective fluid-filled sac) behind the knee Other knee joint injuries or disorders can also cause Baker's cyst Radiotherapy is an effective treatment for osteoarthritis because it targets inflammation Inflammation increases the amount of fluid, or synovia, in the knee. So we asked if radiotherapy may reduce both the production of synovia and volume of Baker's cyst. To answer this question, we performed a prospective trial, where we examined 20 knees receiving radiotherapy for knee arthritis. We assigned scores for the degree of osteoarthitis and calculated the cyst volume for a short- (6 to 12 weeks) and long-term (9 to 12 months) follow-up. We measured cyst volume by ultrasound, and found that low-dose radiotherapy improved knee osteoarthritis scores significantly. The average volume of Baker's cysts also decreased from 22.3 ml to 10.7 respectively during follow-up. A decrease in cyst volume of more than 25% compared to the starting volume could be achieved for 75% of the patients in the short-term, and 79% of the patients in the long-term follow up. We conclude that radiotherapy of knee osteoarthritis is an effective treatment that decreases the volume of a Baker's cyst. Most patients respond to this treatment. 
This work compared internal joint drainage of fluid-filled swellings or cysts alone or with cyst wall removal surgery. Forty-two patients with typical fluid-filled cysts or pockets received joint treatment. Specifically, 20 received joint or arthroscopic internal drainage (AI group alone) and 22 received internal joint drainage with cyst wall removal surgery or resection (AICR group) in two locations. We identified reappearance of fluid-filled cysts with medical imaging. We also took knee-specific clinical measurements. The average follow-up period was 24 months. The two treatment groups were similar in age, gender, cyst diameter, associated joint disorder, initial clinical scores, and follow-up period. Relative to the internal joint drainage alone group, the internal joint drainage with cyst wall removal surgery group had increased operation time and more difficulties. In both groups, cyst scores at the last follow-up differed from the starting score. The knee scores improved compared to starting scores; however, the two groups did not differ at the last follow-up. According to imaging results, the fluid-filled swelling disappeared in 11 (55%), shrank in 6 (30%), and existed in 3 (15%) patients of the internal joint drainage alone group. The cyst was absent in 18 (81.8%) and shrank in 4 (18.2%) patients of the internal joint dranage with cyst wall removal surgery group, implying a difference between the two groups. Additional cyst wall removal surgery can lower reappearance rate of cysts (fluid-filled pockets) but increase operation time and surgery complications compared with internal joint drainage of cysts alone.
 Popliteal cysts, or Baker's cysts, are abnormal enlargements of the bursa (a protective fluid-filled sac) behind the knee. This study aimed to compare drainage of popliteal cysts by arthroscopy (minimally-invasive surgery using fine instruments) alone or in combination with cyst wall removal (resection) in terms of clinical outcomes. Forty-two consecutive patients with symptomatic popliteal cysts received arthroscopic treatment. Specifically, 20 of these patients received arthroscopic internal drainage (AI group) alone and 22 received arthroscopic internal drainage combined with cyst wall resection (AICR group) through two small holes, or portals, made in the middle side of their knees (double posteromedial portals). The patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to observe if these cysts re-appeared or recurred. We assigned scores to patients to quantitatively asses their clinical outcomes. Patients were re-examined during a follow-up period of 12-48 months. The median follow-up exam time was 24 months after the surgery. Results: The two groups (AI group and AICR group) were similar in age, gender, cyst diameter, associated joint disorder, preoperative scores, and follow-up period. Relative to the AI group, the AICR group had a significantly prolonged operation time and a higher incidence of complications. Pre-operative and post-operative knee assessment scores differed signficantly in both groups, but there were no differences between the two groups at the last follow-up. According to the MRI results, the cyst disappeared in 11 (55%), shrank in size in 6 (30%) and existed in 3 (15%) patients in the AI group. In the AICR group, the cyst was absent in 18 (81.8%) and shrank in size in 4 (18.2%) patients in, suggesting a significant difference between these two treatment groups. Conclusion: Additional resection of cyst wall (AICR) can result in a lower recurrence rate of cysts but extend the operation time and increase the incidence of perioperative complications compared with arthroscopic internal drainage (AI) of popliteal cysts alone.
The objective is to review the results and issues of joint treatment of fluid-filled swellings or cysts in our treatment center. From July 2007 to July 2009, 11 patients with typical fluid-filled swellings behind the knee were treated with minor joint surgery. All patients had pre-operation imaging to confirm the problem, identify the source, and the associated joint symptoms. Intra-joint symptoms like cartilage deterioration and tears were associated with fluid-filled swellings behind the knee. All patients improved after treatment. Reappearance rate was low. No major issues were encountered. We failed to correct any swelling sources in one patient. Minor joint surgery of fluid-filled pockets or cysts behind the knee with correction of the source and symptom treatment is effective and safe.
 Popliteal cysts, or Baker's cysts, are abnormal enlargements of the bursa (a protective fluid-filled sac) behind the knee. In this study we evaluated the results for patients who underwent arthroscopic treatment (minimally-invasive surgery using fine instruments) treatment of popliteal cysts in our centre and analysed their outcomes, including complications. Patients: From July 2007 to July 2009, we treated 11 patients with symptomatic popliteal cysts by arthtroscopy. All of these patients had preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to confirm the diagnosis, identify the valve opening of the cysts, and the associated tissue damage within the knee joint (intra-articular pathology). We used the Rauschning and Lindgren criteria tp evaluate knee joint symptoms. We found that intra-articular pathology like cartilage degeneration and meniscus tear commonly occurred with popliteal cysts. All patients' symptoms improved after treatment and the cyst recurrence rate was low. The patients did not experience any major complications. However, we failed to identify (and correct) any valve opening in one patient's cyst. We conclude that arthroscopic treatment of popliteal cyst with correction of the valve opening, and treatment of associated intra-articular pathology is effective and safe.
Popliteal cyst, also known as Baker's cyst, occurs in the knee region. Popliteal cysts are caused by increased pressure on the knee joint which results in the abnormal enlargement of a bursa (protective fluid-filled sac) behind the knee to form a cyst. Orthopedic specialists can diagnose popliteal cysts using X-ray computed tomography (CT scan), ultrasound, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI is the gold standard for diagnosis of popliteal cysts Treatment options for popliteal cysts include conservative treatment, traditional surgery, and arthroscopic surgery. In recent years, treatment of popliteal cysts has shifted from traditional surgical removal of the cysts to arthroscopic treatment of intra-articular lesions and the treatment of joint-cyst communication, with good results. However, controversy remains over which treatment method is best. High quality studies that directly compare different surgical methods should help select the best treatment for popliteal cyst. This article reviews previous studies and literature, and describes in detail the epidemiology, pathological mechanism, signs and symptoms, lab and imaging results, diagnosis and clinical treatment of popliteal cysts We compare and summarize different methods to provide basis for clinical diagnosis and treatment of popliteal cyst.
 Popliteal synovial cysts, also known as Baker's cysts, commonly occur in association with intra-articular knee disorders, such as osteoarthritis and meniscus tears. At the tissue level, the cyst walls resemble synovial tissue (tissue that contains a protective fluid surrounding the knee joint), but with evident scarring (fibrosis), and there may also be chronic nonspecific inflammation present. Osteocartilaginous loose bodies may occur within the cyst, even if they are not seen in the knee joint. Baker's cysts can cause posterior knee pain that persists despite surgical treatment of the intra-articular lesion, and they routinely appear on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the symptomatic knee. Symptoms related to a popliteal cyst origin occur infrequently and may depend on the size of the cyst A common normal variant of knee synovial tissue shows a capsule-shaped opening to the semimembranosus-medial head gastrocnemius bursa ( a fluid-filled sac that lies between semimembranosus muscle and superficial muscle in the back part of the lower leg .) This variant may lead to the formation of a popliteal cyst due to chronic leakage of synovial fluid caused by intra-articular tissue damage . Management of symptomatic popliteal cysts is conservative. An orthopedic specialist should first use arthroscopy to examine the intra-articular tissue damage . If surgical removal of the cyst later becomes necessary, the surgeon may use a limited posteromedial approach , where an incision is made in the middle inner side of the knee. Other treatments, such as arthroscopic removal of damaged tissue (debridement) and closure of the cyst valve , are not well studied and cannot yet be recommended.
The purpose of this study was to introduce a modified treatment technique using arthroscopy (minimally-invasive surgery using fine instruments for removal of popliteal or Baker's cyst). These cysts are abnormal enlargements of the bursa (a protective fluid-filled sac) behind the knee. We thought that this modified technique would be effective, so that cysts do not recur in patients who underwent the treatment. From January 2013 to January 2017, 34 patients with symptomatic popliteal cysts were treated with our technique. Patients in a figure-of-four position (lying on back with opposite leg crossed over the knee) had two small holes, or portals, made in the middle rear side of their knees to allow enough space to open the cyst valve, drain and remove the cyst. We assessed reoccurence of the cysts using MRI and assigned scores to evaluate the clinical outcome Patients underwent follow-up examination an average of 14.8 months following the procedure (range, 12 to 36 months). We found and treated lesions (damaged tissue and cysts) within knee joint in all cases; Damage to the cartilage of the knee was most common, occuring in 23 (67.6%) of the cases Patients' scores improved significantly after surgery, and MRI showed that the cysts did not reappear in any case. We conclude that our arthroscopic techninque is effective and safe for treating popliteal cyst.
 Popliteal cysts, or Baker's cysts, are abnormal enlargements of the bursa (a protective fluid-filled sac) behind the knee. They occur most frequently in patients with osteoarthritis (OA), but are also observed in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), who may experience more serious complications, such as cyst rupture. In this study, we report four patients with RA in combination with OA, where we examined six knees. We also provide a brief review of literature on previous similar published cases. This is a retrospective review, where the patients with refractory and/or complicated popliteal cyst have already been treated by arthroscopy, a minimally-invasive surgical technique using fine instruments for removal of popliteal or Baker's cyst We suggest that patients with recurring and complicated popliteal cysts associated with RA or RA in combination with OA consider arthroscopic surgeries. These may include removal of damaged or dead tissue (radical debridement), synovectomy (removal of fluid-producing tissue around the knee joint), or excision of the cyst valve, or entire cyst (cystectomy).
Background: Popliteal cysts, or Baker's cysts, are abnormal enlargements of the bursa (a protective fluid-filled sac) behind the knee. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of arthroscopic (minimally-invasive surgery using fine instruments) knee cavity internal drainage and cyst cavity debridement (removing damaged and dead tissue) of popliteal cysts in knee osteoarthritis patients. Methods: From August 2007 to March 2013, 58 knee osteoarthritis patients with popliteal cyst were treated with arthroscopic knee cavity internal drainage through posteromedial portal (small holes, or portals, made in the middle side of their knees). and popliteal cyst cavity debridement through superior posteromedial portal (a portal above the posteromedial portal) . All patients underwent preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to detect combined tissue damage within the knee joint and the communication between the popliteal cyst and knee cavity. Patients received scores to numerically assess effectiveness of these treatments Results: All patients had neither recurrence of popliteal cyst nor complaints of pain, swelling, or functional impairment on follow-up examination an average of 24 months after surgery The pain (VAS) score decreased significantly and knee function (Lysholm) score increased significantly when compared with pre-surgery scores. We conclude that arthroscopic knee cavity internal drainag eby the posteromedial portal method, and popliteal cyst cavity debridement through superior posteromedial portal are effective treatments for popliteal cyst without recurrence in knee osteoarthritis patients.
 Popliteal cysts, or Baker's cysts, are abnormal enlargements of the bursa (a protective fluid-filled sac) behind the knee. There is a lack of research comparing the clinical effects of arthroscopic (minimally-invasive surgery using fine instruments) treatment of popliteal cysts between the one posteromedial portal (OPP) technique, where one small hole, or portal, is made in the middle side of the knee, and the two posteromedial portals (TPP), where two portals are made, technique. The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of these two techniques for the treatment for popliteal cysts. We invited patients with symptomatic popliteal cysts who had previously undergone either surgery to participate in this study. The patients had received arthroscopy treatment via the OPP technique or the TPP technique. At the final follow-up, the Rauschning and Lindgren criteria, which evaluate knee joint symptoms, and the Lysholm score for knee function were used for clinical evaluation. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was also performed to detect the post-operative recurrence of cysts. A total of 53 patients with symptomatic popliteal cysts were included in this study, including 25 in the OPP group and 28 in the TPP group. The surgery time of the TPP group was significantly longer than that of the OPP group. In the OPP group, the cysts disappeared in 17 patients and reduced in size in 8 patients. In the TPP group, the cysts disappeared in 23 patients and reduced in size in 5 patients. According to the Rauschning and Lindgren criteria, the recurrence rate was significantly lower in the TPP group (0%) than in the OPP group (4%). There was no significant difference in the Lysholm score between the OPP group and the TPP group. We conclude that the TPP technique is more effective and superior to the OPP technique for the treatment of popliteal cysts.
Popliteal cysts, or Baker's cysts, are abnormal enlargements of the bursa (a protective fluid-filled sac) behind the knee. Arthroscopy (minimally-invasive surgery using fine instruments) is a treatment method for popliteal cysts. To reduce the damage to posteromedial (middle, side) knee capsule associated with this treatment, we have developed a direct arthroscopic approach from outside the knee joint (extra-articular) for removal of symptomatic popliteal cysts. This study aims to demonstrate the surgical technique and present the 2-year follow-up results. Removal of the cyst (cystectomy) is performed by an extra-articular surgical approach, where a small hole is made in the side of the knee above the knee joint (a high posteromedial portal). We included twenty-one patients diagnosed with symptomatic popliteal cysts who had unsuccesful previous conservative treatments in our study. At a median follow-up time of 29.4 months, all knees had improved clinical function assessed by Rauschning and Lindgren knee classification criteria scores. The cysts had either disappeared (95.2%) or reduced in size (4.8%). Only one (4.8%) patient had a recurrent cyst, which was removed by ultrasound-guided aspiration. This direct extra-articular arthroscopic technique could be a feasible alternative treatment for symptomatic popliteal cysts.
Asthma is the most common chronic disease of childhood and, in the latter part of the 20th century, asthma became very widespread. Asthma is generally believed to result from gene-environment interactions, which is when two different genes respond to something in the environment in different ways. There is agreement that there are certain times during pregnancy and early in a child's life when environmental factors (such as food, pollutants, temperature) may shape asthma's development. Researchers reviewed multiple environmental, biologic (such as brain chemistry, genes, nutrition, gender, and hormone levels) and sociologic (such as education and socioeconomic) factors that may be important in the development of asthma. Other studies show that multiple steps and actions are required to prevent asthma. Studies that focus on reducing or avoiding allergens (any substance that causes an allergic reaction) are beneficial. Asthma represents an error in how our genes and the environment interact, especially during pregnancy and early infant life. The increase in the number of asthma cases may also signal an increased risk in the general population for the development of other chronic autoimmune diseases, where the body attacks healthy cells. This review of studies focuses on the factors that may be important in the early prevention of asthma before it starts to develop. A better understanding of gene-environment interactions and how they are involved in the development of asthma will help create interventions and treatment programs for individuals in order to prevent asthma.
Asthma is a long-term condition that affects the tubes that carry air in and out of the lungs and makes it hard to breathe. The number of asthma cases is increasing in many parts of the world, particularly in developed countries (countries with a high quality of life, developed economies, and advanced technologies). The present review focuses on recent literature on asthma prevention in childhood. Recent findings show that exposure to some things in the environment as an infant or in early childhood is associated with reduced number of asthma cases, but how these associations are connected is unknown. Recent studies also show limited success in preventing asthma or asthma symptoms when asthma medications are used and then those medicines are stopped. Immunotherapy (treatment that activates or alters the immune system to treat a disease) is another way to prevent asthma. Several studies that use multiple treatment (drugs, therapy, or other steps to improve health) methods showed reduced symptoms of asthma, but these studies did not see any major differences in other measures, such as how well the lungs carried air. In summary, the most promising way to prevent asthma is to use more than one treatment that include changing environmental exposures and diet. More research is needed to understand how the effect of multiple treatments last and to evaluate new treatments to prevent asthma in childhood.
The prevalence of asthma (a disease that restricts breathing) is increasing globally, especially in developed countries. This article focuses on the literature of asthma prevention in childhood. Many early experiences with the environment are linked with reduced widespreadness of asthma, but the reasons are unknown. Recent studies show little success in preventing asthma or its effects with asthma medications, once therapy ends. Immunotherapy, treatment of disease by altering immune system activity, is another treatment for preventing asthma. Groups treated with immunotherapy show fewer allergy developments and asthma. Many multi-treatment trials show reduced intensity of the effects of asthma but not changes in measures like lung function or sensitivity between treatment groups. The most promising prevention treatments of asthma have used multi-treatment strategies with both diet and environmental changes. We need more evidence to measure the effects of multi-treatment trials and new strategies for asthma prevention in childhood.
Asthma, which usually begins in childhood and is the most common chronic disease of childhood, has become very widespread. Asthma is connected with gene-environment interactions, which is when two different genes respond to something in the environment in different ways. There is agreement that there are certain times during pregnancy and early in a child's life when environmental factors (such as food, pollutants, and temperature) may shape asthma's development. This review considers biologic factors, such as brain chemistry, genes, nutrition, gender, and hormone levels, as well as sociologic factors, such as education and economic activity, in the development of allergies and asthma. Studies show that the strategy of decreasing exposure to one allergen (any substance that causes an allergic reaction) does not impact asthma prevention. However, decreasing exposure to more than one allergen has shown a positive effect, such as improved health or symptoms. It is suggested that asthma and other allergic diseases represent an error in how our genes and the environment interact. The increasing number of cases may be a sign that the general population is at risk for developing other inflammatory (when the body reacts to an injury or infection) and autoimmune diseases (where the body attacks healthy cells). A better understanding of the multiple factors that impact asthma and allergies may help researchers understand other chronic diseases.
This article describes the relationship between early-life respiratory infections (infections in the lungs that impact breathing and occur in the first few years of life) and how asthma begins. The article also discusses new strategies to prevent asthma by stopping these infections. Viruses that occur in early life, especially respiratory syncytial virus (a contagious virus that infects the lungs and airway tubes) and human rhinovirus (the common cold), usually occur before asthma starts. These viruses may have different roles in how asthma develops. How airway microbiome (micro-organisms such as bacteria in the lungs) interact with bacteria from viruses may determine that a child will develop asthma. New strategies for preventing these infections that occur early in life, or for weakening the symptoms of infections, are being investigated and may help prevent childhood asthma. In summary, early-life infections are major factors of asthma development. How these early-life infections lead to asthma is from the reactions between the virus, genes, and the environment. New treatment and therapy strategies that target these infections have been researched, and more studies are needed to see if they will help prevent asthma.
An early study on prevention of allergies aimed to determine if allergen-specific immunotherapy (allergy shots) can improve or prevent the development of asthma in children. In this study, 205 children aged 6 to 14 years with allergies to grass and/or birch pollen were randomly put in either the group that received an allergy shot of immunotherapy for 3 years or in a no-treatment group. None of the study participants reported having asthma at the time of the start of the study. Children treated with the allergy shot had much fewer asthma symptoms after 3 years. A test that measures how well the lungs are working were better in the group that received the allergy shot. Receiving an allergy shot over the course of 3 years in children with allergies to grass, birch pollen, or both greatly reduced the risk of asthma.
It has been 15 years since the first prevention of allergy study was published. The study explores the allergist's dream: determining whether allergen-specifc immunotherapy, treatment of disease by modifying immune system activity, can alter the disease and prevent asthma (a disease that restricts breathing) in children with seasonal allergic rhino-conjunctivitis (long-lasting nose and eye problems). Two hundred and five children aged 6 to 14 with grass and/or birch pollen allergy were randomly selected either to receive 3 years of allergen-specific, below-skin injection immunotherapy (treatment of disease by modifying immune system activity) or to join a control group. Some had moderate-to-severe hay fever symptoms, but none mentioned asthma at the start. Treated children had fewer symptoms of asthma after 3 years. Lung sensitivity tests were better in the treatment group. Therefore, a 3-year course of injection of allergen-specifc immunotherapy in children with seasonal allergies to grass, birch pollen, or both reduces the risk of asthma.
Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a contagious virus that infects the lungs and airway tubes and can lead to lower respiratory tract infections (infection in the airways). These infections are a common reason for infant hospital stays, long-term lung problems, and the development of asthma, a long-term condition that affects the tubes that carry air in and out of the lungs and makes it hard to breathe. Many neutrophils (white blood cells that fight infection) enter the airways of children with bronchiolitis (a common lung infection in children and infants) caused by RSV. However, why neutrophils are sent to the site of lung infection is not clear. This review discusses how neutrophils help the immune system respond to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections. Neutrophils can limit how the virus spreads and can activate the immune system to fight the virus. Sometimes neutrophils that are fighting infection can lead to tissue damage. Neutrophils that cause injury to airways when an infant's lungs are being developed have a long-term impact on lung function and may lead to asthma. Medications that can change neutrophils may be explored as a possible therapy for bronchiolitis caused by RSV and prevent the development of asthma. For patients with bronchiolitis caused by RSV, it is best to use a general antiviral medication when also using neutrophils to help fight infection.
Several risk factors for developing asthma are linked with being exposed to certain things during pregnancy. Because conducting research on pregnant women is limited and findings are difficult to interpret, understanding these exposures is challenging. A report published in a scientific journal called Pediatrics outlined the effects of the mother's and infant's nutrition on developing atopic diseases (a genetic tendency to develop an allergy), including asthma in children. Exposure by the mother to vitamin D as a risk for childhood asthma has been investigated, but the results clash. Some studies report that vitamin D may protect against asthma attacks or prevent asthma symptoms from getting worse. While many studies have investigated such links with the risk of developing a disease, the media often reports these findings without including details or other considerations.
Bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) is an increase in sensitivity to different things that cause the airway to narrow. When BHR is the main cause of developing asthma, BHR may be adjusted by internal and external factors as well as by climate and meterologic (atmosphere, humidity, wind, temperature) factors. Inflammation that can make the disease worse, combined with changes in the mucus of airways, brings on or increases bronchial hyperresponsiveness. Viral infections in the upper airway (the nose, nasal cavity, and pharynx or throat area), exposure to allergens in people with tendencies to have an allergy, long-lasting hyperplastic changes (extra cell growth) of the upper airways, irritants (substances that cause discomfort) and pain drugs in the airways are seen as the most likely asthma triggers in vulnerable children and adults. Bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) may be improved with steroid (man-made drugs with a synthetic hormone) and non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (drugs that relieve pain) and with maritime climatotherapy, where a patient is relocated to a different location close to the sea for health reasons. Maritime climatotherapy may improve BHR by reducing the level of irritants inhaled from the air. How maritime climatic cures work are discussed. Metereological (weather) events such as cold weather fronts have shown a negative impact on how asthma disease progresses. An improvement of BHR is observed at the end of climatotherapy using the histamine challenge test, which tests how sensitive airways are to irritants. Future studies on asthma prevention in patients at risk with bronchial hyperresponsiveness and atopy (allergies) should evaluate the effects and importance of maritime climatotherapy.
Bronchial hypperresponsiveness (increased lung sensitivity to airway-narrowing particles) or BHR as the main reason for developing asthma (a disease restricting breathing) may be modified by internal or external causes and environmental factors. Proinflammatory particles with changes to throat mucus promote BHR. Upper airway viral infections, allergen exposure, lasting enlargement of upper airways, airway irritants and pain-relievers may be the most common triggers of asthma in susceptible people. BHR may be improved by treatment with antiinflammatory drugs and coastal weather. Improvement with coastal weather may be because of reduced inhalative irritants and more complex reasons. Possible ideas regarding the means of coastal weather cures are explored. First, initial results from a mediterranean region show a negative effect of weather events like cold weather or faster wind speeds on the progression of asthma. BHR improvement measured by lung response tests has been observed after weather therapy in the Baltic sea area. Future studies about preventing asthma in people prone to BHR and allergy development should help with evaluating treatment effects and the importance of coastal weather therapy for those with bronchial asthma.
Except for avoiding certain factors that cause infrequent types of asthma (e.g. job or asprin-activated asthma), no single action is definitely proven to decrease the risk of developing long-term asthma in people who do not already have the disease.
The National Disease Management Program (NDM Program) represents the basic content of healthcare involving different types of care. The NDM Program coordinates different fields and areas of healthcare. Recommendations are developed through agreement from scientific medical organizations using the best available evidence. The scientific medical organizations that focus on the prevention, diagnosis, therapy, and rehabilitation of asthma agreed on a National Disease Management Guideline for Asthma in 2005. The group agrees that breastfeeding and non-smoking are suggested as a primary prevention measure (preventing disease before it occurs) for expecting parents. Recommendations are made for secondary prevention (identifying disease at an early stage before symptoms start) to avoid allergens (any substance that causes an allergic reaction), smoking or secondhand smoke, and immunotherapy (the treatment of disease by activating or suppressing the immune system). Statements on vaccination and specific immunotherapy are developed for tertiary prevention (slowing or stopping disease that is affecting a patient). This paper presents both the original texts of the recommendations and the evidence supporting the recommendations.
Corticosteroids (an anti-inflammatory drug or supplement to help relieve pain and swelling, also known as steroids) have been used for decades to relieve inflammation, yet there is little data on their effects in humans. Researchers examine the changes in cells and molecules of the immune system, also known as the immunome, in healthy humans after receiving systemic (affecting the entire body, rather than a single organ or body part) corticosteroids. Researchers use multiple ways to examine the immunome in 20 volunteers at baseline (the start of the study), and again after intravenous (medication delivered through the vein) hydrocortisone (steroid medication) given at moderate and low doses. A thorough review of cell characteristics of lymphocytes subsets (parts of a type of white blood cell that is part of the immune system) saw a decline in B cell subsets that work with substances found in body fluids and in T-cell subsets that focus on specific foreign substances after receiving hydrocortisone. However, B and T cells rebounded or increased above baseline 24 hours after receiving hydrocortisone, while natural killer cell numbers (white blood cells that kill cells infected with a virus) remained stable. Additional analysis found several results: less responsive signaling from NF-κB (proteins involved in different cell functions including immunity responses), apoptosis (normal cell death), and cell death signaling that comes before changes in lymphocytes amount, with activation of signaling in natural killer cells and glucocorticoid receptors (receptors that regulates genes controlling development, metabolism, and immune response). This study is the first to methodically describe the effects of corticosteroids on the human immunome and showed that hydrocortisone has different effects on B and T lymphocytes and natural killer cells in humans. A different study reports that at certain doses, hydrocortisone can cause short-term low level in blood lymphocytes several hours after receiving the drug and return to baseline levels (at the start of the study) after 24 hours. Data from the present study have similar results. Different effects are found in the two steroid doses on lymphocytes returning to normal at 24 hours, with total T cells, CD4+ T cells, and B cells increasing above baseline after the high dose and total natural killer cells showing no increase above baseline at 24 hours. Hydrocortisone brings about a rapid decline in monocytes (an immune cell that attacks and breaks down germs and bacteria) and mRNA (a strand of genetic code that provides instructions for building a protein) related to natural immune signaling as early as one hour after receiving the hydrocortisone. These effects come before neutrophil demargination, which increases white blood cells, and a reduction in lymphocytes.
Steroid hormones have long been used to control inflammation, yet there is a shortage of data on their effects in humans. We examined the changes in cellular and molecular immune system measurements, or "immunome" in healthy humans after full-body steroid hormone treatment. We used multi-measurement techniques to find immune system measurements in 20 volunteers at baseline and after hydrocortisone (HC) (steroid hormone) treatment via blood vessel injection at moderate (250 mg) and low (50 mg) doses. We did this to understand how steroid hormones bring about their effects. We examine physical traits of 120 immune cell subsets by a specific molecular technique, and saw a decline in blood-specific, immune-cell subsets, which reached their minimum 4-8 hours after HC treatment. However, B and T immune cells increased above baseline 24 hours after HC treatment, while natural killer immune cell numbers did not change. A specific lab technique showed reduced protein signaling and cell death before immune-cell group sizes changed, with activation of natural killer immune cells and energy-monitoring, steroid hormone receptor molecules. Our study is the first to explore the effects of steroid hormones on human immune system measurements. We show that HC has different effects on human B and T immune cells and natural killer immune cells. Facui et al. showed that 400 mg and 100 mg doses of HC cause a temporary minimum in outer blood immune cells at 4-6 hours and recovery to baseline after 24 hours. Our data agree with these results. We also show different effects of the two steroid doses on immune cell recovery at 24 hours, with total T immune cells, specific sub-type T immune cells, and B immune cells increasing after the 250 mg dose. Also, total natural killer immune cells show no increases at 24 hours. HC leads to a rapid decline in white blood cells and pre-protein molecules related to immune signaling as early as one hour after treatment. These effects preexist migration and reduction of specific immune cell subtypes.
Studies on lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell that is part of the immune system) that are taken from people and returned to the same individuals is performed on nine healthy volunteers to determine the effects of hydrocortisone (a steroid medication used to help calm the immune system) on the lymphocyte pools in blood. The recirculating or re-added part of the new lymphocyte cells returned to volunteers quickly balanced with the total lymphocyte pools and by 1 hour after the cells were put in the body, 21.8% were left in circulation. Hydrocortisone is provided to the volunteers through the vein 24 hours after the infusion of cells. It caused a major but short-term lymphocytopenia (a lower-than-normal number of lymphocytes in the blood) at 4 hours and then lymphocytes returned to normal levels by 24 hours after the injection. Naturally occurring with lymphocytopenia was a big increase in lymphocyte (white blood cell) specific activity, while the total lymphocyte radioactivity (release of energy) in the circulation did not change, suggesting that corticosteroid administration reduced the recirculating cells that were not provided to the volunteers. The lymphocyte counts (white blood cell count) returned to normal after hydrocortisone use. The specific activity also returned to normal. These studies suggest that giving hydrocortisone caused a short-term lymphocytopenia by reducing the recirculating portion of the lymphocyte pool in the blood.
The process and reactions of the immune system from taking alternate- or every-other-day prednisone (a type of steroid drug that works by lowering the activity of the immune system) are investigated in a group of patients with different inflammatory diseases (diseases in which the immune system attacks the body's own tissues). Total circulating lymphocyte (the total number of white blood cells in body fluids) and number of monocytes (an immune cell that attacks and breaks down germs and bacteria that enter the body), as well as lymphocyte subpopulations (parts of lymphocytes or white blood cells), were studied. At 8 a.m. of the day of receiving prednisone, just before the drug was given to patients, blood tests that include lymphocyte and monocyte counts and proportions of lymphocyte subpopulations were found to be normal. Four hours after receiving the prednisone, there is major lymphocytopenia (a condition where there is a lower-than-normal number of lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell, in the blood), monocytopenia (a reduction of monocytes, a type of immune cell, in the blood), reduction of T-cells (a type of immune cell that help protect the body from infection), and the presence of different lymphocyte subpopulations. Studies that focus on lymphocyte reactions showed that lymphocytopenia is due to short-term reduction of white blood cells circulating within and outside cells. All these blood measures returned to normal by 8 a.m. the next day (off the prednisone) and stayed normal throughout the day. The very short-term lymphocytopenia and monocytopenia after prednisone, with normal cell numbers and counts for the rest of the 2-day cycle, are connected with eliminating disease activity, yet did not affect cutaneous delayed hypersensitivity (showing a reaction in the skin after several days) and did not increase the chance of complications with infection. The short-term monocytopenia and lymphocytopenia connected with this drug is best explained as the body redistributing lymphocytes (white blood cells that are part of the immune system) to other parts of the body, particularly the bone marrow.
The growth of knowledge in the field of pharmacokinetics (how the body handles a drug) of prednisolone/prednisone (two types of steroid drugs) has been slow for several reasons. First, the most convenient and specific way to measure these steroid drugs only became possible with the development of high performance liquid chromatographic methods, a technique that separates, identifies, and counts different parts in a mixture that makes it easy to analyze. Secondly, it is necessary to understand the free fraction, or portion of the drug that has an effect on the body, of prednisolone in each plasma (the liquid portion of blood) sample. Third, due to the short half-life (how long it takes for a drug concentration to be reduced to exactly half its initial amount in the blood) of prednisolone, there is no steady state (when how much the body is given of prednisolone is equal to how much of the drug the body eliminates). Therefore, the area under the concentration-time curve (a measure of total exposure to the drug in the body's systems) is needed. Fourth, prednisolone and prednisone can be exchanged for one another or converted to the other, and prednisolone is given intravenously or via injection. These features create disagreement about the correct way to understand how the body is able to handle these drugs. Finally, the total amount of prednisolone that is cleared from the body and the total amount of prednisolone that has an effect on the body increase with more concentration of prednisolone. Therefore, in order to compare pharmacokinetic results (how the body responds to or handles a drug) between different people, the same dose has to be given to patients. The investigations done so far reveal that: 1) using the amount of dose to understand the body's effect explains why an alternate- or every-other-day treatment with prednisone leads to fewer effects in the body; 2) it is not a limiting factor that prednisone can convert to prednisolone; 3) hypoproteinaemia (lower than normal levels of protein in the body) does not cause an increase of the amount of drug in the body that can have an effect; 4) patients with liver failure, kidney failure, or kidney transplant, as well as people with other conditions, have an increased amount of the prednisolone drugs - while patients with other conditions such as Crohn's disease have decreased amounts of prednisolone. The biological importance of the changes in how the body handles these steroids is supported, in part, by changes at the clinical and immune cell level.
The growth of knowledge in the activity of prednisolone/prednisone (a steroid hormone with immunosuppressant effects) has been slow for many reasons. First, convenient and specific methods to measure these steroids only became available with the creation of advanced lab techniques. Secondly, prednisolone is connected to certain liver proteins. Since the unconnected amounts of prednisolone are important, it was necessary to measure the unconnected amount in each blood sample. Thirdly, due to the short span of prednisolone, no balance is achieved. Thus, specific measurements needed to always be measured. Fourthly, prednisolone and prednisone are interchangeable and prednisolone is given into the blood in an inactive form, attributes which created issues about correct interpretation of the lab results. Finally, the full-body removal of total and unconnected prednisolone increase with increasing amounts of prednisolone. Therefore, to compare lab results between different patients, measured doses had to be given. The tests performed have shown that (1) the dose-dependent drug reactions partly explain observations that an every-other-day schedule with prednisone leads to less biological effects. (2) The change of prednisone into prednisolone is not limiting, even in patients with very damaged liver function. (3) Subnormal protein levels do not cause increased amounts of unbound prednisolone in living beings. (4) Patients with liver failure, kidney failure or a kideny transplant, subjects older than 65 years, women on estrogen-containing, pregnancy-preventing, oral steroids or subjects taking ketoconazole (an antifungal medication) have increased amounts of unbound prednisolone. However, patients with overactive thyroids, some patients with Crohn's disease (an inflammatory bowel disease), subjects taking specific liver medication, or patients on a specific prednisolone given into the blood (instead of another form of prednisolone) or on some brands of intenstinally-related prednisolone tablets have decreased amounts of prednisolone. The importance of these changed drug reactions is supported partly by changed clinical effects and changed effects on cellular immunofunctions.
Six healthy male volunteers were given 5, 20, and 50 mg of oral prednisone (steroid medication given by mouth) and 5, 20, and 400 mg doses of intravenous, or IV, prednisolone (steroid medication delivered through the vein). Plasma (the liquid portion of blood) and urine concentrations of prednisone and prednisolone are determined by HPLC or high performance liquid chromatographic (a technique that separates, identifies, and counts different parts in a mixture that makes it easy to analyze). How prednisolone attaches to proteins in plasma are also measured. The pharmacokinetics (how the body handles a drug) of both oral prednisone and IV prednisolone are dose-dependent (in which the effects of a drug change when the dose of the drug is changed). There are major changes in prednisone half-life (how long it takes for a drug concentration to be reduced to exactly half its initial amount in the blood), but increases in the half-life of its chemical changes by the body are dose-dependent. How the body clears IV prednisolone from plasma is dose-dependent. The steady-state volume (when how much the body is given of prednisolone is equal to how much of the drug the body eliminates) also increased, but little change in the average time and half-life is found. The binding of prednisolone to plasma proteins was primarily based on the concentration or amount of the drug. The pharmacokinetic measures of prednisolone not attached to proteins or transcortin-free (free of a protein from the liver) are mostly constant with the dose provided. How prednisone and prednisolone can be exchanged for one another or converted to the other varies with time and dose, although the amount of prednisolone is greater than the amount of prednisone. The observed renal (kidney-related) elimination or removal of both steroid drugs are also nonlinear (increases in drug exposure are not directly related to increases in given doses) and unrelated to protein attachment. These studies suggest that how the body handles prednisone and prednisolone are dose-dependent and that attaching to proteins does not fully explain their apparent nonlinear distribution and how it is absorbed and excreted in the body.
In rheumatoid arthritis (when the body's immune system attacks its own tissue, including joints, by mistake), nighttime release of proinflammatory cytokines (a type of molecule from immune cells that is capable of creating inflammation) is not prevented well by endogenous glucocorticoid (a type of steroid hormones produced within the body such as in tissues) and is connected with symptoms of morning stiffness and pain. Taking exogenous or external glucocorticoid during the night reduces morning stiffness significantly more than treatment at the usual time in the morning, although waking to take tablets is unacceptable for patients. Modified-release prednisone tablets are developed to allow it to be taken at bedtime for programmed or scheduled delivery of glucocorticoid during the night. Several studies are conducted, each with 24 or less healthy people, to compare pharmacokinetics (how the body handles or responds to a drug) of a single oral dose of modified-release prednisone (a release of part of a drug at a time other than right after the drug is taken) and the regular prednisone. There is no great difference in pharmacokinetic measures of the doses besides the programmed delay in release of glucocorticoid from the modified-release tablets. Taking the drug after a full or light meal did not affect pharmacokinetic characteristics, but how much of the drug that was circulating or floating in the body is reduced under fasted conditions (on an empty stomach or before the first meal of the day). Evaluating the effect of the drug in 9 patients with rheumatoid arthritis confirmed that modified-release (delayed release) prednisone tablets taken at bedtime with or after an evening meal results in programmed release of glucocorticoid 4 to 6 hours after taking the tablets.
People who received a renal (kidney) transplant appear cushingoid (having different symptoms, often facial puffiness and weight gain, due to too much of the hormone cortisol in the body) while on low doses of steroid as part of multiple drug treatments, including prednisolone. The study group has adult kidney transplant patients with stable functions within the transplanted kidney who got the kidney at least a year ago along with an average daily prednisone dose of 7 mg. The comparison group is healthy people who did not receive a transplant. Prednisolone bioavailability (how much of a drug becomes completely available to the intended part of the body) is measured using an area under the curve (a measure of total exposure to the drug in the body's systems), with prednisolone measured using HPLC, or high performance liquid chromatographic (a technique that separates, identifies, and counts different parts in a mixture that makes it easy to analyze). The prednisolone area under the curve for all transplant patients is significantly greater than the comparison group of healthy non-transplant patients. Area under the curve measurements are much higher in females patients and in patients receiving cyclosporin, a drug that prevents the body from rejecting a transplant. The highest area under the curve measurement is in women on estrogen supplements (pills taken, often to resolve symptoms related to menopause) who are taking cyclosporin. A significantly higher proportion of patients on multiple-drug therapy had steroid side effects compared with those on steroid and azathioprine (a drug that can prevent organ rejection after a transplant). More women than men had side effects, and the area under the curve prednisone was greater in those with side effects than without. The results are consistent with the suggestion that cyclosporin A increases the bioavailability (how much of a drug becomes completely available to the intended part of the body) of prednisolone. The increased exposure to the steroid increased the side effects of steroids in most of the patients. It may be possible to use single-point monitoring (one time measurement) 2 hours after the dose for routine clinical studies.
Kidney transplant receivers appeared puffy and obese while on low doses of steroid from a three-part therapy of immunosuppressive drugs including cyclosporin A (CsA), prednisolone, and azathioprine. The treatment group had adult kidney transplant receivers with stable transplants who had received their kidney transplant at least 1 year ago (43 studies done in 22 men and 20 women) with average daily immunosuppressive prednisone dose. The baseline group was healthy nontransplant patients. The average immunosuppressive prednisolone dose measurement for all transplant receivers was higher than the baseline group by around 50%. A certain test score was higher in female receivers and receivers taking the immunosuppressive cyclosporin drug. The highest score was in women on estrogen supplements taking the cyclosporin drug. More patients on the three-part therapy had steroid side effects versus those on steroid and the immunosuppressive azathioprine drug (17/27 versus 4/15). More women than men had side effects (14/16 versus 7/22). The immunosuppressive prednisone drug score was higher in those with side effects than without. CsA drug increases the usuable amount of immunosuppressive prednisolone drug. The increased exposure to steroid increased steroid side effect severity in a majority of patients. Since the major contributor to test scores was maximum post-dose concentration, single-point monitoring (monitoring 2 hours post-dose) may be used for routine studies.
The effects of single oral (by mouth) doses of prednisone (a type of man-made steroid drug that can help lower certain immune-related symptoms, including inflammation and swelling) on circulating mononuclear cells (major cells in the body that signal the immune system), autologous mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) (the availability of non T-cells to stimulate T-cells), mitogen responses (to help measure immune response), and allogeneic MLR (grouping of white blood cells called lymphocytes from unrelated individuals resulting in T cell activation) are studied in healthy volunteers. Low doses were immunosuppressive (drugs or medicines that lower the body's ability to reject a transplanted organ), causing reduced circulation and amounts of T-cells (a type of immune cell that help protect the body from infection) and monocytes (an immune cell that attacks and breaks down germs and bacteria that enter the body), and major losses in autologous but not allogeneic MLR responses. The maximum effect occurred 6 hours after the drug is provided, and effects are gone by 24 hours. Autologous MLR responses are very sensitive to the effects of prednisone and were significantly and consistently slowed or stopped 2 hours after the drug was provided. Macrophage-enriched stimulating cells (a type of white blood cell that surrounds and kills foreign organisms like bacteria and activates other immune system cells) were more easily slowed than responding T cells. Because autologous MLR may be important in in vivo (experiments within a living human or animal) monitoring of immune responses, its reduction by low dose glucocorticoids (medicines that fight inflammation and work with your immune system) may be important. This suppressive (slowing down) effect must be considered in studies of the autologous MLR in patients receiving glucocorticoid drugs.
The aim of this study is to estimate the effect of corticosteroids (anti-inflammatory drugs that help relieve pain and swelling, also known as steroids) on blood level balance of Th1-related (cells that activate cellular immune responses) and Th2-related (cells that activate hormonal immune responses) cytokines (chemical messengers that coordinate the immune response) in patients with Graves' ophthalmopathy (swelling of the tissue in the area around the eyes). Further, researchers tested the theory of an up-regulation of the Th2 immune response (where Th2 cells increase their responses to a signal from outside the cell to carry out specific functions) during successful treatment with corticosteroids. Chemical messengers in the blood called cytokines are detected in 3 groups of study participants: 20 patients with Graves' disease without ophthalmology, 16 patients with clinical symptoms of Graves' ophthalmology, and 16 healthy volunteers. Corticosteroid therapy consisted of intravenous (IV) infusions (medication delivered through the vein) of methylprednisolone (a steroid drug) and followed by treatment with oral or by-mouth prednisone (a steroid drug) in a gradually decreasing schedule. Blood samples are collected before and after methylprednisolone, 14 days of treatment with prednisone (a type of steroid drug that can help lower certain immune-related symptoms, including inflammation and swelling), and at the end of the corticosteroid therapy.  The findings show a shift in the response of Th2 cytokines in Graves' disease. In patients with Graves' ophthalmology, there is a significantly increased blood concentration of Interleukin 10 or IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine which helps minimize damage to the body caused by the immune's response. In patients that received corticosteroids and had a response from the drug, the balance of certain blood cytokines that were measured had increased and remained increased until the end of the study. In those patients who did not respond to the corticosteroids, the balance of the specific blood cytokines studied had increased after receiving methylprednisolone but declined a great deal as the therapy continued with prednisone. In summary, results show that effective corticosteroid therapy may be related to its influence on Th2/Th1 cytokine profile balance. The upregulation or increase of blood IL-4 and IL-10 during successful treatment with corticosteroids suggests the possibility of using these cytokines to help predict the beneficial effect of corticosteroids in Graves' ophthalmopathy.
It is though that glucocorticosteroids (strong medicines that fight inflammation and work with the immune system) disrupt the elimination of immune complexes (build-up in the blood that can cause infection and problems with the immune system) by the mononuclear phagocyte system (a family of cells that fight foreign substances and are part of the immune system). Researchers studied the effect of a five day course of prednisone (a type of steroid drug that can help lower certain immune-related symptoms, including inflammation and swelling) on how the mononuclear phagocyte system functions in 10 healthy volunteers using soluble (can be dissolved in water) build-up of human immunoglobulin G (an common antibody in the body that protects against infection) as a tool to monitor. The mononuclear phagocyte system function is assessed before giving the steroid treatment and again 24 hours after the last dose of prednisone. The elimination reaction and the use of the immunoglobulin by the liver and spleen did not change after prednisone treatment. This suggests that high doses of glucocorticosteroids have no direct, short-term effect on mononuclear phagocyte system functions.
Birt-Hogg-Dubé is a rare genetic skin disorder caused by genetic mutations and puts people at risk for non-cancerous tumors in hair follicles around the face, neck and chest. It may also lead to early onset kidney cancers, lung cysts which are sacs usually filled with air or gas on the lungs, and sudden collapse of the lung. It is unclear how tumor and lung cysts form in people with Birt-Hogg-Dubé. There are a lot of differences in the physical traits of Birt-Hogg-Dubé, and patients can show any combination of skin, lung, or kidney findings. More than 80% of adult patients with Birt-Hogg-Dubé have lung cysts on X-ray scans of the chest.
Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome (BHD) is a rare, genetic disorder caused by a DNA mutation. The disorder causes hair follicle tumors, kidney cancer, lung cysts, and collapsed lungs. The exact creation of tumor and lung cyst or swellings in BHD is unclear. Physical symptoms, like skin, lung, and kidney abnormalities, vary in patients with BHD. Over 80% of adult patients with BHD have lung cysts or swellings seen via medical imaging of the chest.
The purpose of this study is to create a flow-chart based on x-rays called CT scans to tell the difference between Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome and other lung diseases that have cysts, which are sacs of air or fluid. The study uses CT scans that were taken prior to the study from 33 patients with Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome, 33 patients with a rare disease called LAM where a muscle cell grows in the lungs, and 23 patients with other lung diseases that cause cysts (but are not Birt-Hogg-Dubé or LAM). The CT images are reviewed again to determine the size, number, location, and form of pulmonary cysts (cysts filled with air located on the lung). Cysts mainly located in the lower lung are more likely to be found in patients with Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome than in patients with LAM or in the group with other lung diseases. In the Birt-Hogg-Dubé group, 18 out of 33 patients have cysts that are mostly near the area between the lungs. All the patients in the LAM group and the group with other lung diseases have cysts in different locations. Cysts that are fusiform (wide in the middle and taper at the ends) are more easily observed in patients in the Birt-Hogg-Dubé group. In total, 58% patients in the Birt-Hogg-Dubé group have less than 50 lung cysts, while all patients in the non-Birt-Hogg-Dubé group had more than 50 lung cysts. The biggest cyst is located in the bottom of the lung in 28 of 33 patients in the Birt-Hogg-Dubé group, while 11 of 33 patients in the LAM group and 10 patients in the other lung diseases group have the biggest cyst in the lower lobe. In conclusion, pulmonary cysts in patients with Birt-Hogg-Dubé are usually fusiform, are fewer in numbers, and mainly located in the bottom of the lung near the space in between the lungs. The lung images may assist doctors in identifying the difference between Birt-Hogg-Dubé from other lung diseases that have cysts.
Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome (BHD) is a genetic condition that is often accompanied by non-cancerous tumors in hair follicles around the face, neck and chest, pulmonary cysts which are sacs of air in the lungs, sudden collapse of the lung, and kidney cancer. Birt-Hogg-Dubé is caused by genetic mutations in a gene that helps control cell growth called FLCN. Diagnosing conditions using DNA allows insight in how the FLCN gene works, both within and between families. Patients can present with skin signs and also with a collapsed lung (when air leaks into the space between the lung and chest wall) or kidney cancer. Prevention is mainly focused on early diagnosis and treatment of kidney cancer. This paper gives an overview of current diagnosis and management of Birt-Hogg-Dubé.
Changes in the gene called FLCN, which is a gene that suppresses tumor growth, are responsible for the inherited disorder Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome. This syndrome makes people likely to get non-cancerous tumors in hair follicles around the face, neck and chest (fibrofolliculomas), cysts (sacs of air) in the lungs, sudden collapse of the lung, and an increased risk for developing tumors in the kidneys. Some parts of the gene protein, called folliculin, is shown to have a similar structure to other proteins called DENN. FLCN binds with folliculin proteins 1 and 2 (FNIP1, FNIP2) and with a protein kinase that is a critical molecule for energy sensing. This review summarizes other studies that have studied FLCN functions, including its role in how the body distributes nutrients and other cell processes. Ongoing research efforts focus on understanding the ways FLCN may lead to the development of fibrofolliculomas, lung cysts, and kidney tumors in Birt-Hogg-Dubé patients who have the FLCN mutation.
Heritable DNA mutations in the new tumor stopping gene FLCN lead to the genetic Birt-Hogg-Dubé (BHD) syndrome. The syndrome causes hair follicle tumors, lung cysts or swellings, collapsed lungs, and an increased risk for kidney tumors. While the full protein, folliculin (FLCN), is not similar to other proteins, one end of FLCN is structurally similar to the ends of other proteins that help activate high-energy proteins. This review summarizes FLCN studies regarding its role in cellular, signaling, and cell structure pathways. Current research is on explaining the FLCN-associated pathway driving the creation of hair follicle tumors, lung cysts, and kidney tumors in BHD patients with heritable FLCN mutations.
Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome is a genetically inherited syndrome involving multiple organs. In young patients, kidney tumors that are numerous, in both kidneys, or both can suggest Birt-Hogg-Dubé. Findings outside the kidney, such as changes in the skin, cysts (sacs filled with air) in the lungs, and the sudden collapse of the lung, also help in diagnosis. In conclusion, radiologists (doctors who use x-rays and other electronic images to treat and diagnose patients) may be the first medical care provider to suggest a diagnosis of Birt-Hogg-Dubé. Knowledge of how the disease develops and how to manage the condition, including the importance of the types of kidney growths in a patient, is needed to properly recognize this rare condition.
Loss-of-function mutations in the folliculin gene, which helps suppress tumor growth, cause Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome, which is associated with cystic lung disease, a group of diseases that cause cysts (sacs of air) in the lungs. The risk of lung collapse, which is when air leaks into the space between the lung and chest wall, in Birt-Hogg-Dube patients is 50 times higher than in the general population. The cystic lung disease in Birt-Hogg-Dube is different from other cystic lung diseases because the cysts tend to be at the base of the lung, under the layer of tissue that wraps the lungs and is shaped like a lentil or lens. Recent advances to understand the main functions of the folliculin protein have been made. In addition, in just the last 3 years, the impact of a folliculin gene impairment on the lungs was examined for the first time. In experiments with mice, evidence emerged that another protein called AMPK that signals to other cells and cells connecting to other cells is involved when air gets trapped in the lungs. Also, how human Birt-Hogg-Dube cysts are formed and how they progress has been recently described. The "stretch hypothesis" proposes that cysts in Birt-Hogg-Dube form because of defects in how cells connect to one another, leading to repeated stretching of the lungs and, over time, expansion of different parts of the lung. This idea ties together many of the new data from cell and mouse studies of Birt-Hogg-Dube and from the human studies of the disease. Critical questions remain. These questions include how the stretch-induced cyst formation are formed, if the first formation of a cyst involves a second genetic change, and whether the formation of a cyst involves just the surface of the lung or an interaction between the lung surface and cells under tissues. Overall, understanding the processes of cystic lung disease in Birt-Hogg-Dube may help to understand how it leads to sudden collapse of the lung, with more than 20,000 cases a year in the United States.
Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome is a rare inherited genetic disorder caused by changes in the gene FLCN that makes a protein called folliculin, which helps suppress tumor growth. It is often associated with the development of multiple cysts (sacs of air) in the lungs, sudden collapse of the lung, non-cancerous tumors in hair follicles around the face, neck, and chest (fibrofolliculomas), and kidney tumors. Birt-Hogg-Dubé has no preference between male and female and often appears when people are in their 30s or 40s. Multiple cysts on both lungs are identified using x-rays in more than 80% of patients. More than half experience one or more collapsed lung events which is when air leaks into the space between the lung and chest wall. A family history of collapsed lung is an important clue and suggests a diagnosis of Birt-Hogg-Dubé. Unlike other cystic lung diseases, Birt-Hogg-Dubé does not lead to loss of lung function over time or to ongoing breathing problems. Kidney tumors affect about 30% of patients during their lifetime. There can be multiple number of tumors, and they can be recurring. The diagnosis of Birt-Hogg-Dubé is based on a combination of genetic and medical characteristics and/or studying skin and skin cells with a microscope. For a collapsed lung, care mostly involves doing a procedure called pleurodesis early that involves sticking the lung to the chest wall to reduce space in the lungs and chest wall. Scanning the kidneys for tumors using x-rays and finding out if relatives have Birt-Hogg-Dubé are also ways to manage the disorder.
Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome (BHD) is a rare inherited disorder caused by heritable DNA mutations in the tumor stopping gene FLCN, used to create the protein folliculin. Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome leads to lung cysts or swellings, collapsed lungs, hair follicle and kidney tumors. BHD has no sexual preference and appears in the 30's or 40's. Multiple lung cysts in both lungs are detected in >80% of patients via medical imaging. >50% have one or more episodes of lungs collapsing. A family history of collapsing lungs may help identify BHD. Unlike other lung diseases with lung cysts or swellings, BHD does not lead to loss of lung function overtime and long-lasting breathing deficits. Kidney tumors affect ~30% of patients and can be multiple and reoccuring. Identifying BHD involves genetic, medical, and/or skin-related criteria. Managing BHD involves removing the space between the lungs and chest wall to prevent collapsing lungs. It also involves constant kidney imaging for tumors and searching for BHD in relatives.
Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome is a genetic disorder associated with pulmonary cysts (sacs filled with air in the lungs), non-cancerous tumors in hair follicles around the face, neck and chest called fibrofolliculomas, and kidney tumors. The pulmonary cysts may lead to a collapsed lung when air leaks into the space between the lung and chest wall. In cases of the major, sudden collapsed lung, Birt-Hogg-Dubé should be excluded. The kidney tumors are frequently cancerous but slow-growing. Screening and learning about the health history of family members help doctors discover kidney cancer at an early stage. Birt-Hogg-Dubé is often missed or not recognized as a diagnosis.
Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome is an genetic disorder caused by a loss-of-function mutations in the Folliculin gene (FLCN), a gene that stops or slows tumor growth. A common characteristic of Birt-Hogg-Dubé is pulmonary cysts (sacs filled with air in the lungs) that are mostly located in the bottom of the lung. There is also the risk of a collapsed lung, when air leaks into the space between the lung and chest wall, non-cancerous skin tumors, and kidney cancer. The FLCN protein has different functions in the body, including signaling to other cells and supervising the formation of other proteins. Therefore, FLCN cells that are damaged are thought to have reduced activity in other proteins and increase activity in others that may lead to the development of kidney tumors. Folliculin also has other functions including cleaning out damaged cells, helping cells connect with other cells, and working with enzymes that activate the proteins that regular cell energy and fuel. How these functions contribute to the lung problems of Birt-Hogg-Dubé are largely unknown. This review is focused on the lung problems of Birt-Hogg-Dubé and highlights recent advances in understanding the cell function of FLCN. The review also provides current ideas related to how cystic lung disease in Birt-Hogg-Dubé is formed. Researchers also discuss important knowledge gaps in the field, including genetic, cell, and physical processes of cyst development, in addition to the timing of when cysts first form.
Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome is a rare, genetic disorder associated with the development of hair follicle tumors, kidney tumors and pulmonary cysts, which are sacs filled with air in the lungs. Birt-Hogg-Dubé is caused by a change in the folliculin (FLCN) gene. This gene makes a protein that is involved is slowing or stopping the development of tumors. Although care for kidney tumors that have a low risk of becoming cancerous is the main focus of long term care, common lung problems in Birt-Hogg-Dubé include cysts and sudden collapsed lung (when air leaks into the space between the lung and chest wall). Because of the lack of awareness, there is often a delay of diagnosis for lung problems with Birt-Hogg-Dubé, and patients are often given an incorrect diagnosis of another lung disease. A family history of a collapsed lung is present in 35% of patients with Birt-Hogg-Dubé. Certain characteristics of cysts, such as size, location, and shape, can suggest the diagnosis of Birt-Hogg-Dubé by using a chest x-ray. A collapsed lung that continues to occur are common and doing a procedure called pleurodesis early on that involves sticking the lung to the chest wall to reduce space in the lungs and chest wall is recommended. A better understanding of the FLCN gene's role in the formation of lung cysts and long term studies to understand the natural history of lung problems of Birt-Hogg-Dubé are needed.
Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome (BHD) is a rare, inherited disorder that leads to hair follicle tumors, kidney tumors, and lungs cysts or swellings. BHD is caused by DNA mutations in the folliculin (FLCN) gene, which helps create a tumor stopping protein or molecule. While managing low-risk kidney tumors is primary for long-term care, lung issues like cyst formation and random lung collapsions are common in BHD. Due to unawareness, identifying BHD is usually delayed. Patients are frequently mislabeled with long-lasting, interfering lung disease, emphysema (a lung disease involving damaged air sacs), or fluid-filled blisters. A family history of collapsing lungs is present in 35% of patients with BHD. Certain attributes of cysts, like size, location, and shape, can help identify BHD by medical imaging alone. Reoccuring collapsing lungs are common. Early removal of the space between the lungs and chest wall is recommended. We need to better understand how FLCN affects lung cyst formation and how lung problems from BHD develop.
Covid-19 (a viral, breathing-related disease) has affected more than 100 countries around the world, and the basis used to decide when patients with Covid-19 can be sent home is different across countries. In China, patients with two negative (or undetected) viral tests for Covid-19 taken at least one day apart can be sent home with no further quarantine (isolation) required. Currently, testing of for coronavirus using a fecal or poop sample is not usually done. This paper describes a patient with Covid-19 whose tests from swabs of the back of the nose and throat were negative but fecal sample were positive for (or had) coronavirus, which causes Covid-19. The stool (feces) sample collected on 27th of February was still positive for genetic material of the coronavirus, 24 days after the first negative swab from the nose and throat. In conclusion, based on the experience from previous epidemics of lung infections, researchers recommend that testing fecal samples for coronavirus should be included into the standard for sending people home to decrease the risk of transmission (or spread) from the digestive system.
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which is a viral breathing-related disease, has affected over 100 countries worldwide. The hospital release criteria of patients with COVID-19 varies across countries. In China, patients with two tests detecting no virus and taken at least one day apart can be released with no further isolation needed. Currently, testing of severe acute respiratory syndrome cornoavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes COVID-19, in poop samples in not regularly performed. We show a patient with COVID-19, whose poop, but not nose swabs, shows traces of the virus. Poop sample collected on 27th of February shows signs of the virus, 24 days after the first nose swab that did not detect the virus. Based on the 2003 SARS virus epidemic, we recommend that poop testing for SARS-CoV-2 should be added to the hospital release criteria to minimize risk of spread from the digestive tract.
For many infections from viruses, traces of the infection can remain in the body after symptoms and transmission (or spread) to others stop. For Covid-19 (a viral, respiratory illness), the relationship between a positive (or virus-detected) nasal swab where a sample is taken from the back of the nose and throat, the development of antibodies (proteins in the body) that fight Covid-19, and the clinical history is unclear. In this study, people who recovered from Covid-19 and volunteered to donate plasma (the liquid part of blood) are screened for genetic material of the virus using a nasal swab. These volunteers also answer a series of questions and are tested for Covid-19 antibodies. There are 11.8% who tested positive for coronavirus, which causes COVID-19, using a nasal swab 14 days after symptoms stopped. Medical history does not show a big association with ongoing positive nasal swab tests. Also, a positive nasal swab >14 days after symptoms stop is not correlated with antibodies against Covid-19 in the plasma. A test measuring the increase of antibodies against Covid-19 relates with being in the hospital for Covid-19. Antibodies against Covid-19 corresponded with time after symptoms stopped to when the samples are collected and how long symptoms lasted. In conclusion, traces of genetic material from coronavirus can be found long after symptoms end in a significant percentage of people who have been diagnosed, which is important to remember when reading swab test results. Continuing to test positive does not correspond with antibody strength or symptoms of Covid-19. If measuring antibodies is used to understand plasma strength, individuals who have had serious Covid-19 disease symptoms may be better donors or donators.
Collection of blood plasma from people who have recovered from the viral, respiratory illness Covid-19, also called convalescent plasma, began in two hospitals in Brazil for treatment of severe patients. People recovering from mild or moderate Covid-19 infection are selected as donors for blood plasma if they have had no symptoms for at least 14 days. Additional tests are done for other infections such as hepatitis and HIV and for antibodies (or infection-fighting proteins) for Covid-19. Among 271 blood plasma donors, 250 have antibodies in the body to fight Covid-19. In 77% of donors, no genetic trace of Covid-19 is found from a swab test and in 88.4%, none is found in blood. At more than 28 days after full recovery, 59 out of 174 are negative (with no virus detected), and 25 out of 69 are positive (with virus detected), but 13 of these are between 35 and 48 days. Additional tests are done to learn more about the level of antibodies in the blood.  Blood plasma collection showed a decline in antibodies that attach to the virus and keep it from entering cells. The donor's weight, days between the start of the disease and repeated plasma collection, and antibody levels are important for predicting possible antibody concentration that can keep the virus from entering cells. In conclusion, a positive test that finds genetic traces of the virus are still detected in 36.2% of cases within 28 to 48 days after recovery. High levels of certain antibody proteins may be used to identify antibodies that can neutralize the virus and make it inactive.
A test called reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) is used to test for infection for the coronavirus (which causes COVID-19 - a viral, respiratory illness) by looking for traces of genes from the virus. The chances of getting an incorrect positive (or virus-detected) result is low when using RT-PCR tests, but false negatives (when a person tests negative - not having the virus - but they are actually positive) are possible depending on swab type and time since symptoms started. The aim of this study is to determine how the likelihood of getting a false-negative test in patients with coronavirus is impacted by the time since symptoms started and the type of swab, a small piece of soft material sometimes on the end of a small stick. Publicly available data from patients who received several RT-PCR tests and identified as positive for coronavirus are analyzed. The likelihood of a positive test decreased with the time passed since the start of symptoms. Samples from the middle part of the throat are less likely to give a positive result than swabs from the throat and back of the nose. The chance of incorrectly identifying an uninfected person because of a false-negative is reduced if negative tests are repeated 24 hours later. For a small chance of a false-positive test (<0.5%), the true number of infected individuals is larger than the number of positive tests. For a higher chance of a false-positive test, the true number of infected individuals is smaller than the number of positive tests. In conclusion, the samples from the back of the nose called nasopharyngeal are more sensitive than the samples taken in the middle of the throat. The later an infected individual is tested after symptom start, the less likely they are to test positive. This finding may influence decisions on identifying infected patients, contact tracing, or disease tracking, and discharging or releasing recovering patients who are possibly still infectious and can transmit the virus.
Certain molecular tools called RT-PCR assays test for infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which can cause a threatening breathing-related illness. RT-PCR tests are very specific and detecting a target when there is none (or a false positive) is low. However, not detecting a target when there is one (or a false negative) is possible depending on the swab and time since symptoms. The authors' aim is to determine the likelihood of a false-negative test in infected patients is affected by time since symptoms and swab type. The chance of detecting the target decreased with time since symptoms. Also, oropharyngeal (OP) or mouth samples are less likely to detect the target than nasopharyngeal (NP) or nasal samples. The chance of incorrectly identifying an uninfected individual due to a false-negative test was reduced if tests showing no detection were repeated 24 hours later. For a small false-positive test chance (<0.5%), the true number of infected individuals was larger than the number of positive tests or tests detecting the target. For a higher false-positive test likelihood, the true number of infected individuals was smaller than the number of positive tests. NP samples are more sensitive than OP samples. The later an infected individual is tests after symptoms show, the less likely they are to test positive. Time since symptoms has implifications for identifying infected patients, tracing spread, and releasing recovering patients who may still be infectious.
In the current Covid-19 pandemic, one possible cause for concern is that some Covid-19 patients sent home from the hospital are testing positive again for (or have) coronavirus, which causes the respiratory lung infection of Covid-19. To better understand what is happening and provide timely information to officials and doctors, researchers searched and reviewed completed studies about patients discharged or released from the hospital who test positive again for the coronavirus. The search found 12 reports, all of which described patients in China. The review of these reports suggests the presence of discharged patients who do not have any symptoms but test positive. However, it is unclear whether they are contagious because a positive test for genetic traces of the virus does not necessarily indicate the presence of replicating and transmissible virus. The review suggests the need for testing different samples at the same time, including, for example, fecal (poop) samples, from Covid-19 patients before and after they are sent home from hospitals.
Many studies have shown that testing positive again for (or having) coronavirus in recovered Covid-19 patients (patients recovered from the serious viral, lung infection of Covid-19) is very common. This study aims to summarize medical and other key characteristics of these patients. The summary will discuss explanations for the return of the virus in recovered patients, how contagious people are after they have recovered from the virus but test positive again, and the care of Covid-19 patients after going home from the hospital. The percentage who re-tested as positive in discharged Covid-19 patients is between 2.4 to 69.2%. Retesting as positive continued from 1 to 38 days after discharge, or release, from the hospital, depending on population size, age, and the type of samples used to test. Currently, several causes of re-positive tests for coronavirus in recovered Covid-19 patients are suggested, including incorrect negative or positive test results; reactivation (when someone appears to have recovered but still has traces of the virus in the body); and being re-infected with coronavirus, but the process leading to these re-positive tests is still unclear. Preventing patients who have recovered and are sent home from testing positive again is an important step to control the spread of the pandemic. To limit the number of false-negatives tests (when a person tests negative but are actually positive for the virus) before being sent home, study researchers suggest doing more than 2 tests. In addition, samples should be collected from multiple body parts if possible, to identify coronavirus DNA before discharge from the hospital. More studies should be done to develop new tests that target a crucial part of the genes from the virus in order to improve its accuracy.
Diagnosis of cases of coronavirus (a virus causing the lung infection known as Covid-19) is based on the count of positive RT-PCR tests, a type of test that looks for traces of DNA from the virus and signals positive if there is virus present. The amount of virus in the body, called the viral load, measured by the RT-PCR test is seen as an indication of coronavirus infection. However, the association of the amount of virus and the severity of the disease is not yet understood. Samples from the back of the nose from 458 patients are tested by RT-PCR for coronavirus. Additional tests are done to measure the viral load. The most common signs are cough, muscle aches and pains, and fever. High blood pressure, diseases affecting the brain and nerves, asthma, and hypothyroidism (not enough thyroid hormone in the body) were the most frequent conditions of other illnesses. Fever, either as the only symptom or combined with others, is associated with high viral loads. During the first week after symptoms start in mild patients up to 60 years-old is the peak of viral load. Children under 10 years old have a high viral load in the first 2 days post-infection followed by a sharp decline. Cases between 10 and 49 years old mostly showed low and moderate viral load during the first 2 days after infection. Patients over 60 years old have high viral load up to the second week after the start of symptoms, indicating the virus stays present in them longer. These findings suggest the viral load in swabs from the nose would help to monitor the coronavirus infection in mild coronavirus disease 2019 cases.
Detecting cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2), which causes a breathing-related viral disease, is based on the count of people which a certain molecular test (real-time RT-PCR) detects. Viral amount by real-time RT-PCR may be a signal of the SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the link between viral amount and severity of the disease is unknown. Nasal samples from 458 patients were tested by RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2.  Most common symptoms were cough (75.8%), muscle pain (66.7%), and fever (48.5%). High blood pressure (18.2%), brain-related diseases (15.1%), and asthma and reduced thyroid function, which affects metabolism, (12.1%) were the most frequent associated conditions. Fever, either alone or with other symptoms, was linked with a high virus amount. The peak of the virus amount was detected in the first week after symptoms started in mild patients up to 60 years-old. Children under 10 years have a high virus amount in the first 2 days after infection with a sharp decline after. Cases between 10 and 49 years mostly showed low to medium virus amount during the first 2 days after infection. Patients over 60 years have a high virus amount up to the second week after symptoms start, indicating the longer presence of the virus in them. The virus amount in nasal swabs may help monitor the SARS-CoV-2 infection in cases of mild coronavirus disease 2019, a breathing-related viral disease.
There is not enough information on how well tests for coronavirus (which causes Covid-19 - a breathing-related illness) can correctly diagnose a positive case (which signals presence of the virus) beyond 35 days after the start of Covid-19. This study aims to describe the percentage of positive coronavirus tests out of all tests, also called positivity rate, using three different measurements over a long period of time. Researchers took 268 samples from 180 Covid-19 patients with symptoms. These samples are tested using an RT-PCR test that finds traces of genetic material of the virus and a blood test to look for antibodies (proteins used by the immune system to fight infection). Researchers used 3 electrochemiluminescence assay (ECLIA) test formats that can look for multiple types of antibodies in the blood, 4 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) tests that test for antibodies for the coronavirus and can provide information about past exposure to Covid-19, and 1 lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) test format that can detect active coronavirus. After the first clinical sign for Covid-19 starts, the positivity rate and other measures to find the percentage of positive and negative (no virus) results in tests that are true positive, called positive predictive value, and true negative results, called negative predictive value, are calculated each week. Combinations of tests are measured to better understand how the primary tests are working. Maps are created to show how the different tests operate. During a follow-up period of more than 9 weeks, a type of ECLIA and one ELISA antibody test showed stable positivity rates after the third week. Except for ECLIA, the positive predictive value (percentage of positive tests that are true positives) of the other tests similar to ECLIA are ≥95% for Covid-19 only after the second week. ELISA and LFIA have somewhat lower positive predictive values. The IgM antibody that suggests a recent infection did not have enough information to do predictive calculations. An orthogonal testing approach is when a person who tests positive are tested again with a second test. Orthogonal testing provided a positive predictive value of ≥ 95% for patients who probably had the disease (e.g., symptomatic patients). After the second week, negative predictive values (percentage of negative test results that are true negatives) of all but the IgM antibody test are ≥95% for patients with a low or moderate chance of likely having the disease before being tested. When reading results from coronavirus tests, the estimate of the chance of having the disease before confirming with a test, the time that blood is drawn, and test characteristics must be considered. An orthogonal testing approach when a person with a positive results receives a second test increases the accuracy of positive, but not negative, predictions.
The number of blood tests that check for antibodies (infection-fighting proteins) for the coronavirus (which causes COVID-19, the lung infection) has skyrocketed in the past year. Concerns have been raised on the performance of the tests, depending on the disease severity and the time of the test after symptoms start. Therefore, confirming the performance of the test using an unbiased sample is required in order to understand and describe the antibody data. Researchers aim to assess the performance of six available blood tests, the seroconversion (when the body starts producing antibodies), and how the body creates antibodies in response to coronavirus infection. The study included 528 blood samples from 156 patients with follow-up visits up to 6 months after the start of symptoms and 161 blood samples from healthy people. The total amount of antibodies increased and remained above 95% after six months when using certain tests to identify antibodies. At early times after the start of symptoms, a blood test that looks for certain antibodies that suggest recent infection has the best ability to correctly diagnose a positive (or virus-containing) case. Two types of antibodies, IgM and IgG, appear at the same time in most circumstances, and when performed together, the ability to correctly diagnose a positive diagnosis increases. The severe and the moderate clinical forms have major associations with a higher number of positive tests and antibody levels. The ability to correctly have a negative (or no virus) test among negative people is found in all evaluated blood tests, but the ability to correctly diagnose a true positive varies depending on the time after the start of symptoms and the type of test.
This study aims to monitor the amount of coronavirus (which causes COVID-19 - the breathing-related illness) in the blood, also called viral load, and the specific, infection-fighting proteins used by the immune system, called antibodies, among patients with coronavirus and healthy travelers who have the virus but no symptoms. Samples from 57 hospitalized Covid-19 patients and 8 asymptomatic carriers (people who have the virus but no symptoms) are tested. Among seriously ill Covid-19 patients, there is a higher viral load in the throat, sputum (lung), and stool samples at 3-12 and 6-21 days after symptoms start. Among carriers with no symptoms, the viral load is found to stay for a shorter time period (1-8 days) in the throat and in the digestive system. Antibodies to fight the viruses responded in 51.4% of confirmed patients and 62.6% among asymptomatic people within 66 days from symptom starting. The average time between the start of symptoms and positive (or detected) antibodies is 30 days for the IgG antibody, and 23 days for the IgM antibodies, which often suggest a recent infection. Of 170 returning healthy-travelers to China, 4.7% were asymptomatic carriers within 2 weeks, and the positive result among them for the IgG and IgM antibodies is 12.8%. The IgM/IgG antibodies confirmed 3 suspected coronavirus cases, even though they tested negative for coronavirus using another test. When compared to other viruses that impact the lungs, Covid-19 has fewer asymptotic carriers and has a lower antibody response. Covid-19 also has a longer period of time developing antibodies in recovered patients. These findings highlight how complex transmission or spread is in Covid-19.
This study monitors virus amonts and naturally-created blood antibodies, which combat foreign viruses, of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes a breathing-related viral disorder, among infected patients and carries without symptoms from returning healthy travelers. The throat swabs, mucus, and poop samples from 57 hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, and 8 virus carries without symptoms, among 170 returning healthy travelers, were tested with a molecular tool. Results show higher virus amount in throat, mucus, and stool samples at 3-12 and 6-21 days after symptoms first showed among severely ill COVID-19 patients. Shorter virus lifetime (1-8 days) was seen in the throat near the mount and digestive tract of carriers without symptoms. Specific blood antibody detection rates were 18/37 (51.4%) and 23/37 (62.6%) among the 29 confirmed patients and 8 carriers without symptoms, respectively, within 66 days from start of symptoms or detection. Average duration between start of symptoms and antibody results was 30 and 23 days, respectively. Of the 170 returning healthy-travelers to China, 4.7% were infected showing no symptoms (8/170) within 2 weeks. Antibdoy detection rate was 12.8% (12/94). Antibody detection confirmed 3 suspected SARS-CoV-2 cases, despite other test results not detecting the virus. Relative to other breathing-related viral infectious diseases, COVID-19 has fewer carriers without symptoms, lower antibody response rates, and a longer antibody production duration in recovered and contacted healthy people. These results show the complexity of COVID-19 spread.
Introducing lithotripsy, a non-surgical method to break masses like kidney stones into pieces, into medical practice changes the type of complications that may occur after operations. The main complications are inflammatory infections that may result in pain, redness, or swelling. New and improved methods of breaking down stones, avoiding small stone fragments and sending them through the kidneys to be released through urine are searched. The authors develop a method to break stones using a continuous-wave diode laser, which is a constant stream of laser light that can also reduce the scattering of stones by using a hot-spot or energy-focused effect. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of controlling the fragmenting of urinary stones (hard masses of minerals in the bladder), using a continuous-wave diode laser as a method of preventing inflammatory infections. Researchers analyzed 1666 cases of patients with kidney stones who underwent different methods to remove kidney stones. These methods include percutaneous nephrolithotripsy/nephrolithoextraction (removal of stones by a small incision through the skin and stones pulled out of the incision) and ureterolithotripsy/ureteroextraction (when a flexible tube is inserted through the bladder and the ureter which connects the kidneys and bladder and stones are found with a camera and removed). An additional analysis on 90 patients is also done on patients with stones that were fragmented into tiny pieces using different lithotripters, non-surgical devices that crush stones using shock waves. The method of controlled stone fragmentation by a diode laser with a hot-spot effect is tested on samples of 26 kidney stones during or after operations. For the first time in clinical practice, this method is tested in the bladder (with 10 patients). In the group that underwent a small incision to remove the stone, infections and inflammation complications after the procedure occurred in 34.1% of cases. In the group that had stones removed from the incision (nephrolithoextraction) had complications in 24.6%, and in the ureterolithotripsy group where a tube and camera are used, there are 7.8% cases with complications. In the ureterolithoextraction group, there are complications in 2.5%. The analysis makes it possible to find things that lead to the development of infectious or inflammatory complications. For the first time, there are successfully performed ten operations of stone fragmentation using a continuous-wave diode laser with a hot-spot effect. Controlling the scattering of fragments of stones makes it possible to reduce the number of infectious and inflammatory complications and is done in the bladder as an example for testing this method. In conclusion, using a laser to control fragmented stones with the hot spot effect is a promising way to prevent infection and inflammation complications in patients with possibly infected stones since small pieces of stones and their spread within the urinary system is avoided.
New advanced technology for breaking up stones in the kidney and the tube to the bladder changes the nature of issues after operation. Among them, the main issues are inflammatory infections. This influences the search for new, improved ways of breaking up stones to avoid small fragments and spreading stone-associated infection in the kidney and bladder system. We have created a method for controlled breaking up of stones with a special laser with a hot-spot at one end. This study evaluates the effectiveness of controlled breaking up of stones in urine using a special laser with a hot-spot at one end to prevent inflammatory infections in clinics. We analyzed 1666 patient cases of patients with kidney stones who had operations to remove the stones in the kidney and urine. We also analyzed any complications in 90 patients who had treatment with various devices to break up stones: sound waves, pressurized air, and lasers. The method of controlled breaking up of stones with a special laser with a hot-spot was tested on 26 kidney stone samples collected after surgery. For the first time in clinical practice, this method was tested in the hole in the bladder of 10 patients. In the group that had a small cut to remove kidney stones, infections and inflammatory issues after surgery occured in 34.1% of cases. In the group that had a cut and small tube to remove stones, infections and issues occured in 24.6%. In the group that had a small cut to remove stones in the urine, infections and issues occured in 7.8%. In the group that had a cut and tube to remove stones, infections and issues occured in 2.5%. The analysis helped identify factors that promoted infectious and inflammatory issues. For the first time in clinical practice, there were 10 successful operations of breaking up stones with a special laser with a hot-spot. Controlled breaking up of stones, which may reduce the number of infectious and inflammatory effects, was done in the bladder to test the method. The method of using a laser with a hot-spot to break up stones, developed and tested in clinical practice, may prevent infectious and inflammatory effects in patients with possibly infected stones since their previous stone fragmentation. This method may also prevent spread of stone-associated toxins and bacteria in the urinary system.
Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) is a procedure to break up stones in the body by using shock waves and an X-ray to target the stones. Researchers search for the effects of patient characteristics (age, sex, and body mass index or BMI) and stone characteristics (density, location, and size) on how successful ESWL procedure is on stones in the kidneys, ureters (tubes that carry urine from the kidney to the urinary bladder), and bladder. This study is intended to increase the knowledge of doctors on the effect of different patient characteristics on predicting how successful using extra-corporal shock wave lithotripsy is. Researchers evaluate 155 patients who receive ESWL for stones in the kidney and ureter (tube that carries urine from the kidney to the bladder) over a 3-month period. The stone size in millimeters (mm), density, and its location is determined using an x-ray scan before patients received treatment. ESWL is considered to be successful if the size of remaining kidney stone fragments after the procedure are ≤3 mm and if ureteric stones are totally cleared. The overall success of ESWL treatment was observed in 65.8% of the 155 patients. There is no major difference seen when the effect of age, sex, and BMI of patients are studied with ESWL outcomes. Also, stone location either in the kidney or ureter (the tube that carries urine from the kidney to the bladder) has no statistically significant effect (not likely to happen randomly or by chance) on the success of ESWL. Stone density and size based on the scanned images have a statistically significant effect on the success rate of ESWL. In conclusion, this study shows that finding out the density and size of stones using a scanned x-ray image before extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) can help predict the outcome of ESWL. Researchers of this study suggest that low stone density and size are highly likely to result in successful ESWL.
Spinal anesthesia (SA) are medicines that numbs the back of patients to reduce pain after surgery. However, most urologists (doctors who specialize in conditions of the urinary or urine-related tract) use general anesthesia that puts a patient into a heavy sleep when doing a flexible ureterorenoscopy (fURS), a procedure that uses a telescope, and occasionally a laser, to break stones in the kidney into pieces. The objective of this study is to provide technical details, results, complications, and patients' satisfaction with fURS when performed under only spinal anesthesia to numb only parts of the body. Researchers analyzed all flexible ureterorenoscopy (fURS) done under spinal anesthesia to treat kidney stones from March 2011 to February 2017. Details of the technique, how long the procedure takes, results, need for additional treatments, complications, and patients' satisfaction are evaluated. There are 234 fURS procedures done under spinal anesthesia considered. SA was done in a certain area of the lower spine in 64.1%. Patients are sent home the same day of surgery. The average stone burden was 13.5 millimeters (± 6.6 millimeters), and the average procedure time is 76.9 minutes ( ± 34.6 minutes). The percentage of patients who are stone free after one procedure is 69.7%. Additional treatments are done in 22.8% of patients. Overall, 96.6% had no anesthesia-related complications. No complications that required general anesthesia or other major complications are noticed. 99.6% of patients are satisfied with spinal anesthesia. No cases of changing from spinal anesthesia to general anesthesia occurred. In conclusion, flexible ureterorenoscopy (fURS)can be performed safely and efficiently under spinal anesthesia when accounting for a few details of the procedure. Patients' satisfaction with spinal anesthesia is very high, and complications are rare. Although spinal anesthesia is usually used in unfit patients for general anesthesia, it may be considered as a good alternative in fit patients.
Mini percutaneous nephrolithotomy (mini-PCNL) is when a doctor makes a small incision in the patient and uses a small camera to help remove kidney stones. The mini-PNCL has become a useful tool to remove kidney stones of different sizes, stones that did not respond to other treatments, and it can also remove stones in the urinary tract, the body's drainage system to remove urine. When lying either flat on the back (supine position) or on the stomach and face down (prone position), a hollow tube with a lens is inserted into the urethra tube that goes to bladder to allow another device such as a catheter (a clean tube that goes into the bladder) into the collecting system which is the series of tubes and ducts of the kidney. A foley catheter (soft tube that is inserted into your bladder to drain urine) is placed in the bladder. An ultrasound (a technology that uses sound waves to take images of the inside the body) is used to look at the kidney and guide access to the collecting system with a needle. Once access is obtained, a small incision (cut) on the skin is made, and the tract through the skin is increased in size. A device called a suctioning access sheath is positioned to act like a vacuum and absorb fragments. A mini-PCNL nephroscope (telescope with camera) is used to evaluate the collecting system. Once the kidney stone is seen, options to break it up include a machine that pulverizes stones with shock waves or ballistic energy, or a laser is used to break up kidney stones. A flexible tube can be used to ensure removal from the collecting system. A thin, flexible tube that holds ureters (tubes that carry urine from the kidney to the urinary bladder) open called a stent can be used for drainage. The tract is sealed. Guidelines for care after the procedure and for troubleshooting techniques for mini-PCNL are reviewed along with the surgical steps in an available video. There are few clinical trials comparing mini percutaneous nephrolithotomy (mini-PNCL) with standard percutaneous nephrolithotomy and ureteroscopy, a procedure where a small telescope is inserted through the urethra and bladder and up the ureter tube to where the stone is located. There is some evidence to suggest a difference in those needing blood transfusions or transfers when comparing mini- and standard PCNL, as well as differences in stone-free rates when comparing mini-PCNL with ureteroscopy for the treatment of lower pole stones, common kidney stones that are unlikely to pass on their own.
Mini percutaneous nephrolithotomy (mini-PCNL) is a tool to remove a variety of stones including: large kidney stones > 2 cm, lower kidney stones > 1 cm, kidney stones unaffected by shockwaves or surgical extraction, stones in complex tubes transporting urine, and large, unchanged stones causing inflammation in tubes carrying urine. After lying down, an open-ended tube to collect urine, device to collect stone fragments, or device to block escape of stone framgents is inserted into the urine tube. A thin tube is placed in the bladder to drain pee. Guided sound waves are used to explore the kidney and reach the urine-collecting system with an 18 g surgical needle. Once access is obtained, a small 0.5 cm skin cut is made and the opening is enlarged with wires. A metallic or self-enlarging vacuum is placed with x-ray guidance. A rigid, small tube with a lens is used to explore the urine-collecting system. Once a stone is observed, options for breaking it up include using a device with sound waves and bullet energy, or special laser. Using a tube with a scope can ensure full removal from the urine-collecting system. A tube to keep the urine flowing can be placed against or with urine flow for drainage. The opening is sealed with a special surgical sealant. The accompanying video (Supplementary Video S1) shows guidelines for care after surgery and troubleshooting techniques for mini-PCNL along with the actual surgery. There are a few trials comparing mini-PCNL with the standard treatment option. There may be a difference in urine transfer rates between mini- and standard PCNL. There may also be differences in stone-free rates between mini-PCNL and the standard treatment of lower kidney stones.
This study aims to assess the effectiveness and safety of minimally invasive percutaneous nephrolithotomy (MPCNL), when a doctor makes a small incision in the patient and uses a scope to remove kidney stones versus the standard percutaneous nephrolithotomy that uses a larger instrument to remove stones. Researchers analyze data from published clinical trials. Eligible trials are from the following databases: MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library. The articles of these clinical trials included a list of other existing studies that are also reviewed. The analysis includes 10 trials with 1612 patients. The data gathered and analyzed from the 10 trials found revealed information on the following: stone-free rate, how long the procedures take, length of hospital stay, red blood cells decrease, fever after the procedure, and urine leakage. Researchers also analyzed additional data on the effects of vacuum suction (vacuuming up stone fragments) and multiple kidney stones. For vacuum suction effect, it reveals a difference in the stone-free rate in the vacuum suction group but not in the non-vacuum suction group. There is no significant difference in how long the procedure took between the vacuum suction group and the non-vacuum suction group. There is no significant difference in having a fever after the procedure between the vacuum suction group and the non-vacuum suction group. In conclusion, this analysis suggests that minimally invasive percutaneous nephrolithotomy (MPCNL) is a safe and effective method for treating kidney stones compared with the standard percutaneous nephrolithotomy process. Additionally, the vacuum suction effect in MPCNL played a more important role. When it comes to multiple or staghorn (larger) stones, the longer procedure time in MPCNL could not be ignored.
Two common ways to treat kidney stones are: the Mini-Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy (M-PCNL), which is when a doctor makes a small incision in the patient and uses a scope to remove kidney stones, and Retrograde Intrarenal Surgery (RIRS), a procedure that uses a laser and a viewing tube to remove kidney stones and does not make an external incision. The aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness and safety of M-PCNL and RIRS in kidney stone treatment in patients over 50 years old. A total of 125 patients, 65 who had RIRS, and 60 who had M-PCNL, are included in the study. Age, gender, BMI (Body-Mass Index), ASA (American Society of Anesthesiology) scores of the patients; stone size, stone location, operation side, having extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy or ESWL procedure in the past, HU (Hounsfield Unit) values to measure the density of stones, length of hospital stays, stone-free rates, complication rates, blood loss after the procedure, transfusions needed after the procedure, and patients who needed a second operation are recorded. Stone-free rates are calculated 3 months and 6 months after the procedure. The data between the RIRS and M-PCNL groups have similar characteristics in age, gender, BMI, HU, stone size, operation side, stone location, ESWL history, operation time, transfusion rates needed after the procedure, and complications after the procedure. When the ASA categories are evaluated to determine the risk of surgery before the procedure, the average ASA scores, ASA I, and ASA II data had similar characteristics in both groups. When the ASA 3 scores are evaluated, the number of ASA III patients in the RIRS group is statistically significantly (the result is unlikely to be random or by chance) higher. When hospital stay duration and blood loss after surgery are examined, the RIRS group is found to be beneficial. The stone-free rate at the 3rd and 6th months after surgery are statistically significantly higher in the M-PCNL group. M-PCNL and RIRS are methods that can be used safely and effectively in patients over 50 years old who need kidney stone surgery. M-PCNL is found to be more advantageous in terms of stone-free rates, and it requires less secondary interventions, such as a second procedure. RIRS is beneficial in terms of short hospital stays, blood loss after surgery, and applicability to patients who are not suitable for the prone position when patients are face down on the stomach.
Kidney stones are a major burden on the health care system. The number of kidney stones has increased from 3.8% in 1970 to 8.8% in 2010 in the United States, and yearly healthcare costs are at $3.8 billion. It is estimated that more than half a million people a year visit the emergency room for kidney stone problems. The most common symptoms include blood in the urine, pain in the back and sides, groin, or stomach area (abdomen). There are many treatment methods available for managing kidney stones. These options range from non-invasive (non-surgical) outpatient procedures that do not require hospital stays to invasive (surgical) procedures requiring staying in the hospital and an increased risk of complications. Extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL) is a truly non-invasive procedure as opposed to other surgical treatments used, such as retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) and percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) that require an incision into the skin. ESWL is effective because it can crush stones inside the body into smaller parts, which are then released from the body when going to the bathroom. Shockwaves are generated and focused on a point within the body. The shockwaves go through the body with little damage to surrounding tissues. When the stone changes, there is a big difference in the density of the stone which may produce a larger reach of energy due to a lot of shockwaves in a small area of the body. This energy can overpower the strength of the stone, resulting in breaking the stone into smaller parts. Repeating this process leads to the pulverizing of the stone into small fragments that the body can then pass through the body with no pain.
Kidney stones are a major burden on health care. The proportion of cases of kidney stones has increased from 3.8% in 1970 to 8.8% in 2010 in the United States, with yearly healthcare costs of 3.8 billion US dollars. More than half a million people a year visit the emergency room for kidney stone issues. The most common symptoms are blood in the urine and pain at or near the abdomen. There are many treatment options for kidney stones. They range from non-surgical away-from-hospital treatments to surgical procedures needing hospital care and increased risks of side effects. Extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL), or kidney stone removal with shockwaves, is a truly non-srugical procedure compared to other surgical treatments like kidney surgery with a camera tube and making a small skin cut to remove stones. The success of ESWL comes from pulverizing stones into small stones, which are removed naturally by the body. Shockwaves are created and focused on a point in the body. The shockwaves spread through the body with minimal loss of energy (and therefore damage) due to small density or hardness differences of the surrounding body parts. At the boundary between the stone and body fluid, a large difference in hardness, along with many shockwaves in one area, creates a large burst of energy. Via different mechanisms, this energy can break up the stone. Repeating this process pulverzies the stone into small fragments that the body can remove painlessly and naturally.
Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) is a procedure that involves making an incision in the skin, inserting a tube to reach the stone, breaking it up into small pieces - sometimes using a laser, and removing it from the body. PCNL is the first choice treatment of kidney stones larger than 2 cm. This study aims to evaluate if lasers perform as well as non-laser devices in patients with kidney stones. Researchers searched published studies to find the differences in the preparation before or during surgery, the number of complications after surgery, and the stone-free rate (patients that no longer have stone or stone fragments) in patients with kidney stones who had either laser or non-laser PCNL. The number of complications are pooled together and analyzed. How long the procedure takes and length of stay at the hospital or doctor office are also analyzed. Six papers including 732 patients (311 patients underwent the procedure with a laser PCNL and 421 with a non-laser PCNL) are included in the analysis. Surgical time and post-operation stay were shorter in the non-laser group. The stone free rate is significantly higher in the non-laser group. Patients undergoing laser PCNL had a slightly higher risk of a fever >100.4°F after the procedure. The need for a blood transfusion (transfer) is not different between the laser and non-laser group. There is a higher need in the laser group for a thin tube called a stent to be placed in the body to help drain urine, but it is not a major difference between the two groups on needing a stent. In conclusion, non-laser percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) shows better surgical outcomes and a better stone free rate when compared to the laser PCNL.
Medical expulsive therapy uses medication to relax certain muscles in the body to release small kidney stones. The main goals of medical expulsive therapy are to increase stone release along the tube that carries urine from the kidney to the bladder called the ureter to avoid obstruction, reduce pain, and avoid the need for surgical and other procedures. This review focuses on the findings from animal and human studies that investigate the ways drugs work in the ureter and how drugs may potentially help release stones from the body. How the ureter tube, that carries urine from the kidney to the bladder, is able to contract changes over time and makes interpreting results from studies on drugs difficult and, therefore, hard to find the best drugs for medical explusive therapy. However, the current types of drugs used for patients with stones include α1 -adrenoceptor antagonists and calcium channel blockers, that can increase the size of the urinary tube to allow stones to pass, as well as nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) for pain. There are promising drugs under development for study.
Managing stones in the ureter (the tube that carries urine from the kidney to the bladder) has changed over the last few decades, and several treatment options exist. These options depend on the stone size, location, and other patient and stone factors. While open surgery (cutting tissues so the surgeon has a full view of the organs) is now rarely performed, the use of medications to treat stones, which is called medical expulsive therapy (MET), has been controversial and perhaps only recommended for large stones in the ureter. Common treatments are either shockwave lithotripsy, where shockwaves are focused to one point in the body and used to crush kidney stones into dust, or ureteroscopy, a procedure where a small telescope is inserted through the urethra and bladder and up the ureter to where the stone is located. Ureteroscopy is recommended for larger stones. The overall practice of managing stones has remained mostly unchanged, but new methods and ways to deliver treatment have surfaced in modern times. Advancements have occurred in all areas of stone disease to try and refine treatment and balance it with cost, patient choice and quality of life. Sharing information on technology and showing their effectiveness and safety will eventually result in new recommendations among guidelines and new gold standards for care.
Treating kidney stones in urine tubes has changed over the last few decades. Many treatments exist depending on stone size, location, and other factors. While large-cut surgery is rarely performed, drug treatment for removing stones is controversial and perhaps only recommended for large stones away from the kidney. Main treatments include using shockwaves or a flexible telescope to help remove kidney stones, with the latter usually recommended for larger stones. While the general idea of how to manage kidney stones has remain largely unchanged, the modern era has made new treatments to do so. Advances have occured in all areas of treating the urinary system. These advances try to improve treatment while balancing cost, patient choice, and quality of life. Spreading these technologies and demonstrating their success and safety will lead to new recommendations for international guidelines and new standard treatments.
Acylations are parts of molecules that help groups of atoms called acyl groups connect to compounds in the body. Eight acylations are recently identified on histones, which are proteins that provide structural support to a chromosome (DNA) and sometimes act as the spool that the thread-like DNA wraps around. These 8 types are called propionylation, butyrylation, 2-hydroxyisobutyrylation, succinylation, malonylation, glutarylation, crotonylation and β-hydroxybutyrylation. New evidence suggests that these histone changes affect how information from genes are used to build proteins or other molecules. These histones are also built different and have different functions from other common histones. In this review, researchers discuss how some histones are regulated in the body and how some acylation proteins bring about the effects of other acylations and their functions. Researchers develop a model to explain their understanding of how different histone acylations is regulated by metabolism (digestion) of other enzymes, which then adjust the regulation of genes.
Histones are proteins that provide structural support to a chromosome and sometimes act as the spool that the thread-like DNA wraps around. Over time, the knowledge on the role of histones has significantly changed. At first, histones were only known as DNA packaging proteins, but later it was discovered that they act outside of cells as a powerful antimicrobial, an agent that can kill microorganisms or stop their growth. They may also be self-destructive agents. Histones were found to be the most abundant proteins within neutrophil extracellular traps (net like structures that protect against infection) and highlighted their microbicidal function that kills microorganisms such as fungi, bacteria, and viruses. Also, histones outside of cells proved to be involved in triggering worsening inflammatory (the body's natural reaction against injury and infection) and blood clotting responses, depending on the cell type affected. Because of this, several investigations were conducted to study the potential of histones and the substances they may produce as either a sign of a normal or abnormal process in the body (biomarkers or signalers of normal or abnormal processes) or possible ways to use them to fight different diseases. The main objective of this review is to summarize and discuss the most up to date and advanced information on the beneficial and harmful roles of histones and also their possible use as biomarkers and treatments.
Histones proteins are known for their ability to attach to and regulate how instructions and information from DNA are used to build proteins or other molecules. However, histones are also present inside and outside cells where they help protect cells and promote inflammatory responses, the body's natural responses to disease or injury. Histones are a major part of neutrophil extracellular traps (net like structures that protect against infection) that contribute to killing bacteria but also to inflammatory injury. Histones can also directly kill bacteria, fungi, parasites and viruses, outside the body in lab experiments and in a variety of animals. In addition, histones can trigger inflammatory responses in some cases acting through receptors (target sites) on cells or other receptors and sensors that are part of the immune system. Histones outside cells help address organ injury (lung or liver) and the process of sepsis which occurs when the body's response to an infection damages its own tissues. It also helps with low blood platelet counts that help the immune system and blood clotting.
Histones are proteins that bind to and influence DNA expression. However, histones are also located both inside and outside the cell away from DNA to defend the host and promote inflammation. Histones help certain immune cells kill bacteria but also lead to injury from inflammation. Histones can also directly kill microorganisms like bacteria, fungi, parasites, and viruses inside and outside the host body. Also, histones can trigger inflammation by contacting certain target sites or pathways. Histones outside of cell influence organ injury (lung, liver), sepsis (life-threatening self-attack from immune cells due to an infection), low count of blood platelet (which help make blood clots), and blood clot generation. Some proteins can bind and block these possibly harmful actions of histones.
The cancer or tumor causing role of changes to histone proteins is one of the most important discoveries in cancer research. Histones are proteins that provide structural support to a chromosome and sometimes act as the spool that the thread-like DNA wraps around. Recurring mutations (changes) that target histone genes are described in brain tumors in children, in a rare type of noncancerous bone tumor that begins in cartilage chondroblastoma (noncancerous bone tumors in cartilage), and in giant tumors of bones and other types of tumors. The finding that mutant histones can cause cancer and tumors, also called oncogenic, and drive development of tumors in children lead to the new term "onchohistones". In this review, researchers describe the organization of the multiple genes that build histone proteins and the role of histone mutations in cancer. Recent works show that recurring mutations during pregnancy target both N-terminal (nitrogen-containing) tails that are on histones and interact with DNA and the central part of the histone that folds in different types of tumors. Oncohistones (the mutant histones that can cause tumors) often occur more in tumors affecting children and adolescents. Notably, in many cases, the mutations target only some of the genes that interact with histone proteins and are frequently associated with specific tumor types or with tumors that come from specific locations. In conclusion, the overview of recent advances suggests that it's possible histones mutation can form cancer or tumors. However, further studies are necessary to fully describe the process of histone proteins that may cause cancer (oncohistones), as well as to evaluate how they might influence cancer classification, the course of the disease, and the identification of new treatments.
Histones are proteins that provide structural support to a chromosome and sometimes act as the spool that the thread-like DNA wraps around. Histones that are released from injured or dying cells and remain outside of cells can lead to damaged molecules. In fact, there are high levels of histones in humans during hyperinflammatory states, when the immune system goes into overdrive, such as acute respiratory or breathing-related distress or sepsis, which occurs when the body's response to an infection damages its own tissues. Understanding this process of changes in molecules because of histones is just starting. However, making histones ineffective with antibodies (infection-fighting proteins), histones that attach to or break down proteins, and certain carbohydrate (sugar-containing) molecules that regulate functions of blood vessel walls have shown promising treatment effects in computer models of acute respiratory distress syndrome and sepsis. Various cell types that are dying or are activated in the neutrophil extracellular traps (net like structures that protect against infection) are likely involved in too many histones being released which can worsen tissue injury and may result in multiple organ failure. An uncontrolled inflammation response is considered as the major event; however, blood clotting or scabbing because of histones are new events showing a bleeding disorder. Also, regulating how the environment can cause changes that affect the way genes work and chemical changes of histones appear to be very important in their functions. In this paper, researchers review the current knowledge of the role of histones in acute respiratory distress syndrome and sepsis, and discuss potential anti-histone treatment of these life-threatening disorders.
Histones are proteins that provide structural support to a chromosome and sometimes act as the spool that the thread-like DNA wraps around. Linker histones play a major role in organizing DNA and proteins to create the nucleus (genetic material) inside cells (a process called chromatin organization) and are key players in balancing the genome, which is an organism's complete set of genetic instructions. Linker histones not only interact with DNA and other histones but also with other chromatin (DNA-attached) proteins. These interactions prove to be very important for the higher levels of chromatin organization. Recent results find that one linker histone, called Hho1p, physically interacts with another protein (Arp4) and that the removal of this interaction by deleting the gene for the linker histone leads to many changes in the physical folding of DNA structures (a process called chromatin compaction). Here, researchers show that the healthy interaction between the yeast linker histone and Arp4p is critical for keeping the genome stable and for controlling how sensitive cells are to different types of stress. The interaction that stopped between the linker histone and Arp4p leads the changed yeast cells to start aging early. Cells die young and are more sensitive to stress. These results prove the role of linker histones and chromatin changes in aging cells through their cooperation in chromatin compaction (folding of DNA structure) and thus maintaining genome stability.
Linker histones are major proteins for organizing DNA and affect the balance of genes. As the fifth type of histone proteins, the linker histones not only work with DNA and other histones but also other proteins that bind to DNA. These interactions organize certain DNA regions like DNA loops, DNA expression sites, and nucleus regions with specific DNA segments. Our recent results show that a specific histone - Hho1p - of brewer's yeast physically interacts with another protein called actin-related protein 4 (Arp4). Removing this interaction via deletion of the gene for the linker histone in arp4 mutant cells leads to global change in DNA binding. We show that healthy interaction between the yeast linker histone and Arp4p is needed for DNA stability and controlling cellular sensitity to different forms of stress. The removed link between the linker histone and Arp4p leads the mutant yeast cells to premature aging. Cells die young and are more sensitive to stress. These results show the role of linker histones and DNA-protein remodeling in aging by their role in DNA binding and maintaining DNA stability.
Linker histones are proteins that play a major role in organizing DNA and proteins to create the nucleus (chamber holding the DNA) inside cells and how instructions from genes are used. Linker histones, and non-histone proteins called HMG1/2, can have an effect on making a copy of a gene. The two types of proteins attach to DNA is similar ways, although they are different in how they structured. Whether linker histones and non-histone proteins compete for binding (attaching) to the nucleosome (a section of DNA that is wrapped around a core of proteins) has not been investigated. The possibility for either opposite or cooperative effects on regulating genes must be considered at this point.
Histones make up the chief protein part of DNA. They help to maintain the structure of chromatin, which helps package the DNA in a compact form so it fits in the cell nucleus (chamber holding the DNA in a cell), and regulate how the instructions from genes are used. The long double-stranded DNA molecule winds around a group of histone proteins to form a structure called nucleosomes. Nucleosomes compact DNA within the cell wall. There are five major types of histones, namely H1/H5, H2, H3 and H4. H3.3 is a subtype of H3 histone and can be encoded (given instructions on how to structure it) either by the H3F3A or H3F3B genes independently. Molecules that combine to build proteins are called amino acids. Some are found in the histone tails and are sites of changes to the properties and make-up of proteins, a process called post-translational modifications (PTMs). These changes in histones are involved in regulating how genetic information is used from genes. Mutations (changes) in histone genes can affect sites of PTMs, causing changes in how genes can be silenced or slowed. These effects are directly linked to changes in cells by altered genes. Ongoing changes in H3.3 histone are increasingly identified in several illnesses and developmental disorders. This review attempts to shed light on the diseases associated with H3.3 histone mutations.
Histones are proteins that provide structural support to a chromosome and sometimes act as the spool that the thread-like DNA wraps around. Changes to the properties and make-up of proteins, a process called post-translational modifications (PTMs), are important for regulating chromatin (a substance within a chromosome made up of DNA and protein) and how information from genes are used. Few studies have investigated all the levels of histone PTMs that are needed for dividing cells, changing their functions, and maintaining these specific cell types. This study uses an approach called fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) with another technique called targeted mass spectrometry to detect and sort specific white blood cells that infection. FACS is used to sort closely and distantly related white blood cells from normal human blood moving throughout the body. Researchers tested and confirmed the method to sort cells to decrease time and number of steps after FACS to analyze histone changes. In healthy donors, histone PTM levels are different in immune cells called T cells, and most of PTMs stay stable for up to 2 days after blood is drawn. Large differences in the levels of histone PTMs are found across the mature, functioning blood cells, though no differences are found in closely related T cell subtypes. The results show a streamlined approach for identifying changes in histone PTMs in cell types separated by FACS.
Eukaryotes are cells commonly identified by having a nucleus (chamber to hold DNA). Eukaryotes provide genetic instructions to the following histone proteins that are similar but not identical: H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. Histones are proteins that provide structural support to a chromosome and sometimes act as the spool that the thread-like DNA wraps around. With DNA, these core histones come together into the basic structural unit of DNA packaging called the nucleosomal octamer. Importantly, histones for H2A and H3 are maintained as genes that develop a new function and are applied for chromatin, a substance within a chromosome made up of DNA and protein. In this context, the identification of core histone-like genes in the fluid that fills cells in Marseilleviridae viruses is a new finding with possible importance to understanding the origin of eukaryotic chromatin. This study analyzes and compares core histone-like genes from the genes of all known Marseilleviridae viruses, as well as other Marseilleviridae genes relevant to the beginning of the eukaryotic DNA replication machine. Using different approaches, researchers show that Marseilleviridae histone provide genetic information to H2B-H2A and H4-H3 structures. Marseilleviridae core histones form similar copies to each of the four eukaryotic histone groups. This suggests that parts of the Marseilleviridae core histone changed before eukaryotes changed functions. Researchers also show that Marseilleviridae genes provide information to other enzymes that form organisms similar to eukaryotes. This is a relevant finding given that DNA unwinding enzymes influences histone structure and the folding of DNA and is the second most abundant nuclear protein after histones. In conclusion, an early origin for Marseilleviridae histone genes is a more limited explanation than gene transfers + gene fusions + enough changes to remove relatedness to eukaryotic changes in functions within the H2A and H3. It is suggested that Marseilleviridae histone genes and their DNA genes are possibly taken from an organism that can replicate DNA that diverged before the beginning of eukaryotic core histone types for H2/H2A.Z and H3/cen H3. These results also imply that core histones are used in viral DNA folding and/or protection from viral-degrading, host enzymes called endonucleases.
While DNA of multi-celled and some one-celled organisms both encode a specific DNA-binding region, only multi-celled organisms encode the core proteins that DNA wraps around (core histones). With DNA, these core histones assemble into an 8-piece in the nucleus that binds DNA in multi-celled organisms. Importantly, certain core histones are kept as proteins capable of general-purpose or region-specific DNA-binding proteins. In this context, identifying core histone-like "duplicates" in the replication factories for the virus Marseilleviridae (MV) is a new finding with usefuleness to understanding the origin of chromosomes in multi-celled organisms (eukaryotes). Here, we analyze the core histone duplicate genes from all known MV genes and other MV genes related to the origin of the DNA replication site for multi-celled organisms. With different evolutionary approaches, we show that specific MV DNA-binding areas encode necessary histones of possible pre-eukaryotic origin. MV core histones form similar groups to each of the four eukaryotic groups of known and variant core histones. MV core histone groups may have divered before eukaryotic duplicate genes gained new functions (neofunctionalization) associated with paired linear chromosomes and variable histone group assembly. We also show that MV genes encode a pre-eukaryotic DNA replication enzyme that forms a sister group to eukaryotes. This is a useful finding since these DNA replication enzymes affect histone settlement and DNA compaction and is the second most common nuclear protein after histones. The combined region architecture and evolutionary analyses shown here suggest a primitive origin for MV histone genes is a tighter explanation than gene transfers + fusions + mutations to eliminate relatedenss to eukaryotic neofunctionalizations within histone groups without loss of relatedness to each of the four core histone sister groups. We thus suggest that MV histone doublet genes and their DNA replication gene were possible obtained from an organism with a specific DNA replication site that diverged before the origin of eukaryotic core histone variation. Core histones may have been used before in viral DNA compaction and protection from host proteins.
Successfully treating patients with systematic lupus erythematosus (lupus - when your immune system attacks healthy cells) is limited by the different causes, its presence in multiple organs and systems, and a complex immune response. Treatments that target certain inflammatory (infection-fighting) processes in the body may be needed for some patients. One such target is the type I interferon pathway, a specific immune system pathway. Type I interferons increase the production of interferon genes (genes that allow communication between cells to activate the immune system) and brings about critical immune responses to fight viruses. Problems with the signaling in type I interferons are found in patients with lupus, and the extent of the problem is connected to how serious the disease is, making type I interferons possible targets for treatment. The recent approval of the type I interferon-blocking antibody medicine, anifrolumab, by the US Food and Drug Administration for treating patients with lupus shows the value of targeting this pathway. Nevertheless, the interferon pathway has multiple cells and signaling parts that are not completely understood. Understanding the type I interferon pathway and how it relates to lupus will be valuable for future development of lupus treatments. This review summarizes the immune process of the interferon pathway, its association with disease development, and therapeutic methods that target problems interferon pathway.
Treatment success for patients with full-body or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), an inflammatory disease in which immune cells mistakely attack joints, skin, brain cells and more, is limited by muti-factor disease causes, multi-organ damage, full-body effect, and complex causes for immune cell dysfunction. Treatment targeting creation and survival of antibody-creating immune cells are not effective for all patients, indicating a need to target other inflammatory groups. One target group is the type I interferon pathway, a cellular signaling pathway that affects the entire immune system. Type I interferons increase the amount of certain signaling proteins and influence important antiviral responses. Impaired type I interferon signaling is detectable in many with SLE and similar diseases. The extent of this impairment is linked with disease severity, making type I interferons a possible treatment target. The recent approval of the type I interferon blocking molcule or antibody, anifrolumab, by a government agency for treating SLE demonstrates the value of targeting this pathway. Still, the interferon pathway affects multiple targets and signaling pathways that are incompletely understood. Understanding the complex type I interferon pathway and its influence on lupus disease will be valuable for further development of targeted SLE treatments. This review summarizes the immune middlemen of the interferon pathway, its link with disease creation, and treatments targeting the pathway when it is impaired.
Because treatment options in advanced systematic lupus erythematosus (lupus - when your immune system attacks healthy cells) are limited, there is an urgent need for new and effective treatment alternatives for selected cases with severe disease. Bortezomib (BTZ) is a specific, reversible drug that stops the function of the protein complex called proteasome that breaks down unneeded or damaged proteins. This study reports the effectiveness and safety of all patients receiving BTZ for lupus in Sweden during 2014-2020. Eight females and 4 males are included with an average disease duration of 8.8 years when BZT is started. Kidney involvement was the main target for BTZ. Reduction of global disease activity is recorded by decreasing scores over time of the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI-2K) that tracks disease activity and remained significantly reduced at the 6-month and the 12-month follow-up visits. From BTZ initiation, levels of a protein that supports the immune system called complement protein 3 (C3) increased significantly after the 2nd treatment cycle, the 6-month, and the 12-month follow-up visits. The urine test showing albumin protein in urine declined over time and reduced significantly at the 6-month and the 12-month follow-up visits. The presence of certain antibodies (infecting-fighting molecules) related to lupus is observed. Six out of 12 patients experienced at least one side-effect during follow-up, the most common adverse events are infections. Tests to measure safety, including blood cell counts, mainly remained stable over time. In conclusion, researchers found beneficial effects of BTZ when used in combination with corticosteroids (an anti-inflammatory drug also known as steroids) in most patients with severe lupus who do not respond to the standard treatments. Reduction of proteinuria (elevated protein in urine) was observed over time as well as changes to specific antibodies. In most patients, the side effects were tolerable but mild adverse events were not uncommon. Special attention should be paid to infections and low levels of antibodies.
Systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus) is a type of chronic autoimmune disease where the body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy cells and tissues. The mechanisms and processes of how lupus develops remain unclear. Therefore, effective therapies with low side effects for lupus are lacking. Recently, therapy using mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), cells that are present in adult bone marrow and umbilical cords, for diseases including lupus has gained increasing attention. This therapy can improve the signs and symptoms of lupus by promoting the development of Th2 and Treg cells that are involved in activating the immune system and slowing the activity of other cells that are overactive in cases of lupus (Th1, Th17, and B cells, etc.). However, MSC therapy is also reported ineffective in some patients with lupus, which may be related to the stem cells or patient's factors. Therefore, the treatment effects of MSCs should be further confirmed. This review summarizes the status of MSC therapy in lupus treatment and potential reasons for the ineffectiveness of MSC therapy from three perspectives. Researchers suggest various changes in MSC methods that may be beneficial in slowing the immune effect of MSCs in lupus. However, their safety and protective effects in patients with lupus still need to be confirmed by more evidence.
Metformin is a medication that has been proposed as a treatment for systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus - when your immune system attacks healthy cells). Metformin targets certain cells in the immune system that play a critical role in development of autoimmune diseases, which are diseases where the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy cells and tissues. This review addresses the evidence and knowledge gaps on whether a beneficial effect of metformin in lupus may be due to a restoration of redox homeostasis, a balanced level of reactive oxygen molecules that signal to other cells. Clinical trials in lupus patients with mild to moderate disease activity and studies in mice have provided encouraging results for metformin. The mechanism that creates this therapeutic effect is largely unknown. Metformin regulates redox homeostasis in specific situations. Multiple cell types contribute to lupus. The major knowledge gaps are whether the effectiveness of metformin is linked to a restored redox homeostasis in the immune system, and if it is linked, in which type of cells does it occur. Researchers also need to know which patients may have a better response to metformin, and whether it relates to a specific mechanism or process in the body. Finally, the identification of specific biological factors to predict treatment outcomes would be of great value.
Metformin, an anti-diabetic medication, may treat full-body or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), an inflammatory disease in which immune cells mistakely attack joints, skin, brain cells and more. The primary target of metformin, a specific energy-generator in the cell, is linked with electrical balance in immune cells, which influence the creation of diseases in which immune cells mistakely attack healthy cells. This article reviews the evidence and knowledge gaps on whether metformin's beneficial effects in lupus may be due to a restored, balanced electrical state. Clinical trials in SLE patients with mild to moderate disease severity and mice studies show encouraging results for metformin. How this beneficial effect is achieved is largely unknown. Metformin monitors electrical balance depending on the situation. Multiple cell types contribute to SLE, with evidence of increased cellular stress in certain immune cells called T cells and neutrophils. The major knowledge gaps are whether the success of metformin is linked to a restored electrical balance in the immune system. If it does, in which cell types it occurs? We also need to know which patients may have a better response to metformin, and if it corresponds to a specfic biological process? Finally, identifying markers to predict treatment outcomes would be very useful.
Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is a type of protein that promotes and develops immune cells at the start of an immune response and keeps them alive. A low-dose of interleukin-2 can restore changes of immune cells called T cells and Treg cells, resulting in the start of remission (recovery) in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus - when your immune system attacks healthy cells). However, to date, no research has been carried out on the effectiveness of low-dose IL-2 in the treatment of lupus nephritis, a type of kidney disease caused by lupus. The aim of this study is to investigate the kidney response to low-dose IL-2 in patients with lupus nephritis that is not responding to standard treatment. The study includes 10 patients with lupus nephritis who failed to achieve a complete response to standard treatment or who improved and then worsened while being treated with at least two standard treatments. One treatment cycle consists of IL-2 given by an injection every other day for 2 weeks followed by a 2-week break. All patients receive three cycles of IL-2 and are then followed up for another 12 weeks without any increase in the dose of the previous treatments or steroids. Of the 10 patients enrolled in the study, 7 (70%) achieved 50% or more improvement in proteinuria (elevated levels of protein in the urine) at 12 weeks after starting IL-2 treatment. Average proteinuria is significantly reduced by 50.3% at week 12. There is also a 71% decrease in red blood cells in urine at 12 weeks. An antibody (infection-fighting molecule) associated with lupus called anti-ds DNA decreased from the start of the study to week 12, while protein complements C3 and C4 used to monitor the immune systems are slightly increased. A significant expansion of the immune Treg cells, from 9.3% at the start of the study to 16.6% at 12 weeks, is also found. No serious negative events occurred while patients receive the treatment. In conclusion, low-dose IL-2 therapy may have a promising role in the treatment of refractory lupus nephritis as an alternative and safe treatment approach. Low-dose IL-2 may be used in combination with other medicines in clinical practice.
Clinical trials studying the infection-fighting antibodies called rituximab and ocrelizumab failed to show benefit in severe cases of lupus nephritis, a kidney disease caused by lupus (when your immune system attacks healthy cells). Obinutuzumab is an antibody that reduces B-cells, a type of protein that produces antibodies but also associated with diseases such as lupus. Researchers compared obinutuzumab with a placebo (inactive substance that looks like a medicine) for the treatment of lupus nephritis in combination with standard therapies. Patients with lupus nephritis receiving standard treatments such as steroids are randomly put in a group to either receive obinutuzumab or a placebo. The drug or placebo are given on day 1 and weeks 2, 24 and 26, and followed through week 104. The main result is complete kidney response at week 52. Additional analyses through week 104 are also done. A total of 125 patients are randomly placed into either the obinutuzumab or the placebo group and did not know which group they are in. Achievement of complete kidney response is greater with obinutuzumab at week 52 and at week 104. Improvements in other kidney and blood tests are greater with obinutuzumab. Obinutuzumab is not associated with increases in serious negative events, serious infections or deaths. Reactions related to the infusion (injection) occurred more frequently with obinutuzumab but are not serious reactions. In conclusion, improved kidney responses through week 104 are observed in patients with lupus nephritis who received obinutuzumab plus standard treatment compared with standard treatments alone. Patients were able to tolerate side effects of obinutuzumab, and no new safety issues were identified.
The objective of this study is to determine the effectiveness and safety of belimumab and anifrolumab, medications that lower the strength of the body's immune system, in patients with active systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus - when your immune system attacks healthy cells). An analysis using data from different clinical studies is performed to understand the effectiveness and safety of belimumab, anifrolumab, and a placebo (sham treatment) in patients with active SLE. Researchers found 6 relevant clinical studies that together have a total of 2,757 patients. Using an assessment tool to measure how disease reacts to medication and other therapy, the response rate at 52 weeks is much higher in the belimumab and anifrolumab groups than that in the placebo group. The response rate for belimumab is much higher than the response for anifrolumab. Using data, a ranking system suggested that belimumab is most likely the best treatment for a response rate, followed by anifrolumab, and placebo. The number of serious negative events are not significantly different among the 4 treatment groups. In conclusion, based on the assessment (measurement) of response rate, belimumab has the best response effectiveness, followed by anifrolumab. However, there is no difference in the number of serious negative events among the treatment options.
The study aimed to determine the relative success and safety of belimumab and anifrolumab, common immunosuppressive drugs, for patients with full-body or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), an inflammatory disease in which immune cells mistakely attack joints, skin, brain cells and more. An analysis was performed on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the success and safety of belimumab 10 mg, anifrolumab 300 mg, and a dummy treatment in patients with active SLE. Six studies (2,757 patients) were analyzed. Patient health at 52 weeks was much higher in the belimumab 10-mg and anifrolumab 300-mg groups than the dummy treatment group. Patient health for the belimumab 10 mg group was higher than that for the anifrolumab 300 mg group. Based on the analysis, belimumab 10 mg was most likely the best treatment, followed by anifrolumab 300 mg, and the sham treatment. The number of harmful side effects did not differ among the 4 treatment groups. Based on patient health measures, belimumab 10 mg had the best success, followed by anifrolumab 10 mg. However, there was no difference in the number of harmful side effects among treatment options.
Systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus) is a common autoimmune disease where the body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissues. It is unclear how the disease develops. Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) are cells that are present in adult bone marrow and the umbilical cord, and extracellular vesicles released from MSC cells are particles that carry molecules, proteins and other substances between cells. These play important roles in regulating natural immunity and immunity acquired after exposure to a virus or to bacteria, which are involved in many disease development processes. The effects of MSC cells and extracellular vesicles on lupus have been drawing more and more attention during the past few years. This article reviews the changes in the body's immune system and underlying process of MSC and extracellular vesicles in lupus, which provides new insight into understanding the disease development of lupus and guiding therapy.
Lupus nephritis is the most common form systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus - when your immune system attacks healthy cells) that severely impacts organs. About 30% of patients do not respond to standard treatment. This report summarizes a case of treating lupus nephritis by targeting a type of protein called interleukin-17, demonstrating its possible benefit. The case is of a childbearing age woman with lupus who developed lupus nephritis and did not respond to available treatment. During follow up visits with the patient, infection with a common sexually transmitted disease called human papillomavirus (HPV) is detected. A possible trigger and the following care and treatment is based on this discovery. Interleukin-17 (IL-17 - a chemical messenger) seems to be a basic key in lupus and lupus nephritis. Therefore, it is decided to start treatment with an anti-IL-17A antibody drug called secukinumab. After starting secukinumab, clinical and biological features improved, and complete kidney response was achieved.
The objective of this study is to describe the relationship of how the drug called anifrolumab works with the effectiveness and safety in patients who have moderate to severe lupus (when your immune system attacks healthy cells) despite receiving standard therapy. The study uses data gathered from clinical study trials. TULIP-1 and TULIP-2 are 52-week clinical trials of anifrolumab given through a vein every 4 weeks for 48 weeks. Anifrolumab and placebo are compared using different assessment tools and analyses. Relationships between exposure to the medication and key safety events are assessed graphically. Of patients in TULIP-1/TULIP-2 who received anifrolumab (a total of 447 patients receiving a dose amount of 150 or 300mg) or sham treatment/placebo (366 patients), 574 patients completed treatment. In the exposure-effectiveness analyses, treatment differences favoring anifrolumab (at 300) vs placebo are observed across subgroups of the study participants and all analysis populations. The concentration of the drug is found to be a significant factor for having a response, as higher anifrolumab in blood predicted greater effectiveness. There is no evidence of key safety events from taking the drug through week 52 in patients receiving anifrolumab 150 or 300 mg. In conclusion, while higher concentration of the drug in blood predicted greater effectiveness, ongoing positive benefits of anifrolumab 300 mg vs placebo is observed across subgroups in the TULIP trials. There is no evidence of safety events from exposure to the drug.
Using data from clinical trials, the study aimed to describe how anifrolumab, an immunosuppressive drug, operates effectively and safely in patients with moderate to severe full-body or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), an inflammatory disease in which immune cells mistakely attack joints, skin, brain cells and more, under standard treatment. We analyzed two randomized, 52-week trials, called TULIP-1 and TULIP-2, which involved injected anifrolumab treatment (every 4 weeks for 48 weeks). To track patient health, we used specific assessments along with measurements of average anifrolumab blood concetration (Cave) to compare anifrolumab-treated patients, sham-treatment patients, patients who completed treatment, and patients with increased immune-specific genetic markers. Trends between health and key safety events were assessed graphically. Of patients in TULIP-1/TULIP-2 who got anifrolumab (91 received 150 mg, 356 received 300 mg) or sham treatment (366 patients), 574 completed treatment, of whom 470 had high levels of immune-specific molecules. Patient health favored anifrolumab 300 mg vs dummy treatment across all analuzed populations. Higher anifrolumab levels were linked to greater treatment success. There was no evidence of treatment-related safety events through week 52 in patients receiving anifrolumab 150 or 300 mg. Whil higher anifrolumab levels predicted greater success, consistent positive benefit favouring anifrolumab 300 mg vs dummy treatment was seen across assessments in subgroups of the TULIP trials. There was no evidence of treatment-related safety events.
Level of βhCG (a pregnancy hormone) and the presence of any uterine (womb) mass of hydatidiform mole (a cluster of fluid filled sacs) need a careful review or monitoring. These measures are to prevent metastasis (spreading of the cancer to other organs), provide an early treatment, and avoid unnecessary chemotherapy (therapy to combat cancer). A 36-year old, pregnant patient who had a missed abortion was diagnosed as having a molar pregnancy with beta human chorionic gonadotrophin (βhCG) level of 509,921 IU/L. A molar pregnancy is a rare complication where a noncancerous tumor develops in the uterus. Her lung field was clear. She underwent suction and curettage (S & C) procedure, a process that uses a vacuum to remove a fetus. However, after six weeks, AA presented to the emergency department with a massive bleeding. The patient's βhCG level had decreased to 65,770 IU/L. An abdominal ultrasound indicated the presence of an intra-uterine mass. Nevertheless, her βhCG continued to decline. AA was advised to undergo a chemotherapy. The patient refused, citing preference for alternative medicine like herbs instead. She opted for an "at own risk" (AOR) discharge with scheduled follow up. Her condition improved with her βhCG showing a downward trend. Surprisingly, at six months following S & C, her βhCG improved to 0 IU/L. No mass was detected by ultrasound. Brucea javanica fruits along with Pereskia bleo Annona muricata leaves can potentially be useful alternatives to chemotherapy. This idea needs further study.
This study examined patients after embryo transfer. This study aimed to predict the influence of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG - a pregnancy hormone) levels on the probability of finishing pregnancy with delivery. This study evaluated 490 patients pregnant after IVF + ET (lab-grown egg transfer) treatment. The influence of other factors on finishing pregnancy with delivery or loss was determined. These factors included age (patients 20-50), number of transferred embryos (one, two and more) and the length of cultivation. This study also aimed to predict if multiple pregnancy was related to hCG value. The transferred embryos were divided into two groups - early (cultivation 48 and 72 hrs) and prolonged cultivation (PC 96 and 120 hrs). Because of this, the data was evaluated in several levels. The data was analyzed through several statistical algorithms. The hCG level grew more and more rapidly in the course of the 9th to 17th day after an embryo transfer (ET). Probability of one child delivery after the transfer of one embryo overdue after prolonged cultivation grows with increased hCG values on the day of the draw. The hCG value determined what type of pregnancy would occur. The probability of multiple pregnancy increased with hCG values above the average. However, below-average hCG values indicated abortion or biochemical pregnancy. Patients age was not proven to be of significant influence. The hCG level slightly decreased with higher age. An increase in frequency of abortions correlating (linking) to increased age of the mother was once again confirmed. The measured hCG values are considerably different depending on the pregnancy result. Because of this, hCG value is considered a quality predictive factor of the pregnancy result.
Signs of Ectopic (outer-uterus or outer-womb) Pregnancy (EP) can be highly variable. Serum Beta hCG (a pregnancy hormone) estimation plays an important role in early diagnosis. The aim of the study was to determine trends of hCG levels in EP. This study also aimed to explore the role of hCG in decisions related to management and follow-up of EPs. A study of women who had EPs from January 2006 to December 2012 at an advanced tertiary care center in southern India was carried out. These women had undergone treatment based on the hospital protocol. The study identified 337 women with EP. Thirty one surgically confirmed cases were diagnosed below the discriminatory zone of 1500 mIU/ml. Among women who had Beta hCG estimations 48 hours apart, plateauing was observed in 22.5% while decreased levels were noted in 26.8%. Almost half of the cases had an increase in levels. Less than 3% demonstrated an initial fall followed by a rise in titers (concentration). In 23.9%, there was a rise >53% similar to intrauterine (normal) pregnancy. The average pre-treatment Beta hCG was 429.8, 3866.2 and 12961.5 mIU/ml for those who received expectant, medical and direct surgical treatment, respectively. Forty-three women with relative contraindications (unable to take certain treatments) received medical management. Thirty-nine women were lost to follow-up after medical and expectant management. Excluding these women, the success rates of these two modalities (treatments) were 76.6% and 85.0% respectively. No single level of Beta hCG is diagnostic of EP. However, serial (multiple) levels can demonstrate atypical trends in some cases. Therefore, interpretation of these results should be done with clinical and ultrasound evaluations to arrive at a correct diagnosis.
The objective was to determine the correlation (link) between maternal free beta human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG - a pregnancy hormone) concentrations and rates of adverse pregnancy outcomes. Database records were assessed for free β-hCG levels and pregnancy outcomes. Pregnancies with fetal chromosomal or structural anomalies and those with underlying disease were excluded. Free β-hCG levels of < 0.5, > 0.5 and < 2.0, and ≥ 2.0 MoM were categorized as low, normal and high, respectively. Of 17,082 screened women, 13,620 were analyzed. In the first trimester, low β-hCG levels significantly increased risk for intrauterine (normal inner-womb) growth restriction (IUGR), preterm birth, low birth weight (LBW), and low Apgar (newborn test) score. High β-hCG group had a significant decreased risk of preterm birth and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). In the second trimester, both low and high β-hCG groups had significant increased risks of common adverse outcomes. Abnormally low (< 0.5MoM) or high (> 2.0 MoM) free β-hCG levels are associated with an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. High free β-hCG levels in the first trimester may possibly decrease risk of preterm delivery and GDM.
Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG - a pregnancy hormone) is generally measured in serum (blood). However, spot urine samples are also used to assess hCG levels in Japan. The purpose of this study was to understand if urinary hCG can be used clinically as a substitute for serum hCG. A total of 189 samples of serum and spot urine were collected from patients. Samples were collected from patients of normal pregnancy (NP) -13, abortion (AB) -21, extrauterine (outer-womb) pregnancy (EP) 25, and hydatidiform mole (MOL) -7. Sample comparisons were made concerning serum and urinary hCG levels. Hydatidiform mole leads to a cluster of fluid filled sacs from a noncancerous tumor developing in the uterus from a nonviable pregnancy. Initial analysis of sample urinary/serum hCG showed a wide distribution of values. However, the difference in distribution decreased after sample normalization. Urinary/serum hCG of the AB, EP, and MOL groups showed no difference before or after surgery. Serum measurements tended to be similar to that of urinary/serum hCG levels. The presented case indicated that urinary/serum hCG did not correspond (were not linked) to serum hCG levels. Urinary hCG levels are inconsistent depending on whether spot urine is concentrated or diluted. Because of this, hCG levels in spot urine do not always correlate with serum levels of hCG. Data of urinary hCG should be interpreted only after normalization. The authors recommended to determine serum hCG levels rather than normalized urinary hCG levels. This is because the relative urinary/serum hCG was not constant following surgery.
The aim of this study was to investigate if subfertility affects the first trimester levels of pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A) and free beta-human chorionic gonadotrophin (β-hCG - a pregnancy hormone). From this, the study aimed to determine the risk estimates in Down syndrome screening. The study evaluated a cohort of 10,469 pregnant women. All of the participants underwent first trimester screening and responded to a questionnaire. The questionnaire focused on time-to-pregnancy (TTP), which was used as a measurement for subfertility. PAPP-A and free β-hCG levels were measured between gestational week 8 and 13. This data was related to TTP. PAPP-A and free β-hCG levels were significantly lower in women with a TTP ≥24 months compared with the reference group with a TTP <6 months. This led to an increased risk for trisomy (extra copy of a chromosome) for TTP ≥24 months compared with TTP <6 months. However, this risk was not statistically significant. Time-to-pregnancy ≥24 months in spontaneously conceived pregnancies is associated with decreased levels of PAPP-A and free β-hCG.
Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG - a pregnancy hormone) is a chemical created by trophoblast tissue. Trophoblast tissue is typically found in early embryos. Trophoblast tissue will eventually be part of the placenta. Measuring hCG levels can be helpful in identifying a normal pregnancy and a pathologic (abnormal) pregnancy, and can also be useful following an aborted pregnancy. There is also a benefit in measuring hCG in a variety of cancers. This includes choriocarcinoma (tumors in the uterus) and extra-uterine (outer-womb) malignancies.
Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is a pregnancy hormone. The hormone is secreted by the outermost layer of the placenta. The hormone has been linked to fetal growth and various placental, uterine, and fetal functions. To investigate the effects of hCG on clinical endpoints, having knowledge on reference range (RR) methodology and determinants of gestational hCG levels is crucial. Also, a better understanding of gestational hCG function can improve current screening programs and future clinical management. Serum (blood) hCG levels were determined in 8195 women. Gestational age specific RRs using 'ultrasound derived gestational age' (US RRs) were calculated. This data was compared with 'last menstrual period derived gestational age' (LMP RRs) and a model-based RR. The study also investigated which pregnancy characteristics were associated with hCG levels. Compared to the US RRs, the LMP RRs were lower. No considerable differences were found between RRs calculated in the general population or in uncomplicated pregnancies only. Maternal smoking, BMI, monetary income, ethnicity, fetal gender, placental weight, and vomiting associated with pregnancy were correlated with total hCG. This study provides gestational RRs for total hCG. Additionally, this study shows total hCG values and RR cut-offs during pregnancy vary depending on pregnancy dating methodology. This is likely due to the influence of hCG on embryonic growth. This suggests that ultrasound based pregnancy dating might be less reliable in women with high/low hCG levels. Furthermore, this study identifies different pregnancy characteristics that influence total hCG levels. These pregnancy characteristics should therefore be accounted for in clinical studies.
Family doctors often use quantitative human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG - a pregnancy hormone) testing to assess first-trimester bleeding. It is anticipated to find a range of normal results for any given week in the first trimester. It is predicted an approximate doubling over 48 hours in a normal pregnancy occurs during the first trimester. Human chorionic gonadotropin often peaks at about 10 weeks’ gestation before declining and stabilizing. When HCG levels flatline or fail to rise as expected, we consider that the pregnancy might not be viable.
The first trimester screening program offers a noninvasive (nonsurgical) option for the early detection of aneuploidy pregnancies. Aneuploidy refers to the conditions of having an abnormal number of chromosomes. This screening is done by evaluating serum (blood) free β-human chorionic gonadotrophin (free β-hCG - a preganancy hormone), pregnancy associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A), maternal age, and fetal nuchal translucency (NT - area of tissue at the back of an unborn baby's neck) thickness at 11 to 13 weeks of gestation. A beneficial consequence of screening is the early diagnosis of chromosomal anomalies. At 11 to 13 weeks, the relative prevalence of chromosomal anomalies are found to be 1:3 and 1:7, respectively. Chromosomal anomalies are associated with increased maternal age, increased fetal NT, and decreased PAPP-A. However, in a specific chromosomal anomalies, known as trisomy 21, serum free β-hCG is increased. In trisomies 18 and 13, various types of chromosomal anomalies, free β-hCG is decreased.
"We studied how much zinc gets into the body of 15 healthy volunteers after they took different supplements. The volunteers were split into four groups in no particular order. Volunteers in each group took one of these supplements for four weeks: zinc picolinate, zinc citrate, zinc gluconate or placebo (a pill that contains no drugs). The pills contained the same amount of zinc. The groups switched to a different drug every week in no particular order. Zinc was measured in hair, urine, and blood before and after each switch.	 At the end of four weeks levels of zinc in hair, urine and red blood cells were much higher in those who took zinc picolinate. There was no change in the levels of zinc in the body after taking zinc gluconate, zinc citrate or placebo. There was a small rise in the levels of zinc in the clear liquid part of the blood after taking zinc picolinate, zinc citrate and placebo. Levels of zinc in the body can be improved by supplements that combine zinc with picolinic acid, a natural product found in many organisms.	"
This study compared three different types of zinc drugs. The study included 15 healthy people. The people were divided into four groups. Each group took a different type of zinc pill each week for four weeks. The zinc pill types were zinc picolinate, zinc citrate, zinc gluconate, and a fake zinc pill. Researchers measured the amount of zinc in each person's hair, urine, red blood cells, and blood each week. There was more zinc in each person's body after a week of taking the zinc picolinate pills. Those people taking zinc gluconate, zinc citrate, or the fake zinc pills did not have more zinc in their body after a week of taking the pills. The researchers found a very small increase of zinc in the blood of people after the a week of taking the zinc picolinate, zinc citrate, or fake zinc pills. This means that zinc picolinate is the best pill to take to get more zinc into a person's body.
Zinc is known to interfere with volatile sulphur compounds, chemicals that have rotten egg smell and barnyard smell. We studied which zinc salts are better to use in zinc lozenges. Some zinc salts break down in water more easily and let out more free zinc.  We prepared similar lozenges that contained one of the zinc salts that easily let out zinc (zinc acetate or zinc gluconate) or the chemicals that do not let zinc out easily (zinc citrate or amino-acid chelated zinc). All the lozenges contained a hundredth part of zinc. 10 volunteers used the different lozenges in no particular order. We measured the poor smelling sulfur gases. All lozenges worked similarly. This means that suppression of the sulfur chemicals by zinc is not related to how easily zinc salts dissolve in water. Similar results for all lozenges may be due to some chemicals in the mouth interacting with zinc stronger than the salts in the lozenges. Lab experiments suggest the chemical in the mouth that interacts with zinc may be a form of sulfur. 
Zinc's anti-VSC (volatile sulphur compounds) effect comes from free zinc ions, which are the chemicals that allow zinc to work in the body. The objective of this study was to see which type of zinc lozenges work best, the type that has what is called high stability constants or the type that has low stability constants. A lot of free zinc ions appear when low stability constant zinc is dissolved in water, which high stability constant zinc gives few ions. All lozenges looked identical but contained one of four different types of zinc forms, two for each type of stability constants. All of the lozenges contained a small amount of zinc. 10 volunteers took the different lozenges randomly. The results show that the zinc lozenges were effective no matter the stability constant. The stability constant has no effect on the zinc ions' anti-VSC effect. One explanation is that free zinc ions are attracted to chemicals in the mouth more strongly than those in the lozenge. A lab experiment showed that sulphide ions from VSCs may attract free zinc ions to create the anti-VSC effect.
Much attention is given to toxic effect of zinc on the neural system, but little is known about about the other chemicals that accompany zinc. We study how different zinc salts affect nerve cells' ability to work and live. In very small doses, zinc salts were no toxic, except for zinc-citrate. At higher doses of all salts except of zinc-histidinate, the levels of protective cell chemicals decreased and the cells died. Zinc-citrate and zinc-sulphate turned out to be the most toxic salts particularly at low doses. Depending on the dose and type of salt, cells die of different combinations of lack of blood supply to the cell or a pre-determined cell death mechanism. Zinc-sulphate and zinc-citrate provided free zinc in higher doses then other salts, possibly indicating there is a connection between taking in zinc and its toxic effect on the cell. Zinc salts could be divided into three categories with high (zinc-citrate, zinc-sulphate), moderate (zinc-orotate, zinc-acetate, zinc-chloride, zinc-gluconate) and low cell totoxicity (zinc-histidinate).
Research is focused on the ways that zinc is bad for the body's cells, but researchers don't how everything works. This study looks at how various forms of zinc effect cells in the body by testing the zinc on rat cells. The various forms of zinc did not have bad effects on the cells when used at small sizes, except for the form called zinc citrate. All of the various forms of zinc caused cells to die at high amounts except for the form called zinc histidinate. The most toxic of the zinc forms were zinc-citrate and zinc-sulphate. They had bad effects even when used in low amounts. The type of zinc and how much was used affected the way cells died. The cells absorbed more zinc from the zinc-sulphate and zinc-citrate forms. This means that there may be a relationship between the amount of zinc absorbed and how bad it is for the cells. The forms of zinc can be divided into three different categories based on how toxic they are to cells.
New treatments are needed for Herpes simplex virus (HSV) that causes cold sores or genital herpes. Pomegranate is considered to help against infection since ancient times. We studied the activity of pomegranate rind extract (PRE) combined with zinc. PKE and zinc salts were used against different types of HSV. Toxic effect on cells was measured by identifying working cells using commercial chemicals. Zinc sulphate, zinc citrate, zinc stearate and zinc gluconate worked similarly against HSV that causes cold sores, and increased the effect of PKE up to 4-fold. Punicalagin, a chemical extracted from pomegranate, was 8 times more effective against the virus than an equivalent amount of PKE. Punicalagin, a chemical extracted from pomegranate, was 8 times more effective killing the virus than an equivalent amount of PKE. Punicalagin was less effective than PKE in fighting the virus and suppressing its growth. PKE was comparable to the drug aciclovir. PKE also worked against the viruses that are resistant to aciclovir. Zinc sulfate did not affect how PKE worked against the virus and its growth. None of the zinc-PKE combinations had toxic effects on cells. Zinc increases PKE ability to kill viral cells. The combination could become a new treatment applied locally to cold sores. 
New treatments are needed for Herpes. The pomegranate fruit has been used to fight infections since ancient times. This study looked at how zinc and extract from pomegranate rinds (PRE) affect herpes. PRE and zinc were used against herpes and drug resistant herpes in monkey cells. Four types of zinc pills with PRE were strong against the herpes virus. Another compound found in certain plants including pomegranates called punicalagin is 8 times more active against viruses than the same amount of PRE. However, other data showed that punicalagin was less active against viruses than PRE and was comparable to the drug aciclovir. PRE was still effective against drug resistant herpes unlike aciclovir. Zinc sulfate did not affect the ability of PRE to fight the herpes virus. There were no bad effects on the cells from any of the test treatments. The ability of PRE to fight viruses with zinc could be a new treatment for herpes infections such as cold sores.
"Prostate, a a small gland below the bladder that helps men make semen, contains the highest amount of zinc in the body. The amount of zinc available to the body decreases with age. Taking zinc supplements may protect the body against damage caused by the environment and reduces the risk of cancer. The most frequently discussed supplements are zinc sulfate and zinc gluconate We compare the amounts of available zinc in the prostate of male rats after giving them three different doses of zinc sulfate, zinc gluconate, or zinc citrate for 30 days. The availability of zinc in the prostate was very different for different zinc supplements. The availability of zinc in rat prostate was higher only after taking zinc gluconate and zinc citrate. For zinc gluconate, the availability was higher even at the lowest dose. In the rats that got zinc sulfate, availability of zinc has not increased in some parts of the prostate. To sum up, zinc gluconate is worth considering as a zinc supplement for men.	"
Men collect the most zinc in their prostate. The amount of zinc in the body decreases as a person gets older. Taking zinc pills protects the body from chemical imbalance and lessens the risk of cancer. The two types of zinc pills most often studied are zinc sulfate and zinc gluconate. This study compared the different types of zinc pills and doses when taken by rats for 30 days. The results show that the amount of zinc in prostate was different depending on the type of zinc pill taken. The rats had a lot more zinc in their prostates when taking zinc gluconate and zinc citrate compared to rats that did not take any zinc pills. The amount of zinc in the prostate was high even when the rats took zinc gluconate at the lowest dose. There was no increase of zinc in rats that took zinc sulfate. To sum up, zinc gluconate is a worthwhile zinc pill for men who need more zinc.
Zinc salts that dissolve in water are commonly used as supplements. Tablets or syrup with zinc gluconate, zinc sulfate or zinc acetate are used to prevent zinc deficiency and to treat diarrhea (Loose stools) in children. Another source of zinc is zinc citrate that somewhat dissolves in water. It tastes better in syrups, but it is not known if it gets into the body. We measured how much zinc gets into the body of 15 healthy adults after they took zinc supplements without food. The supplements were zinc citrate, zinc gluconate and zinc oxide, which does not mix with water). Same as for zinc gluconate, about half of the zinc from zinc citrate got into the body. Much smaller amounts of zinc got into the body from zinc oxide. Three people did not get any zinc from zinc oxide. Zinc citrate supplement taken without food provided as much zinc to healthy adults as zinc gluconate. It may be another useful supplement for preventing zinc deficiency and treating diarrhea. Zinc oxide, which doesn't mix with water, does not get into the body that well, or not at all in some people. 
Various types of zinc are commonly used as supplements in tablet or syrup forms. These supplements prevent the body from lacking zinc and help treat children's diarrhea along with liquids. Zinc citrate is a form of zinc that dissolves slightly in water and allows more zinc into the body. It is better in syrup form but there is no data on how well its zinc is absorbed in the human body. This study compared how well zinc from zinc citrate is absorbed in the body by giving 15 people 10 mg of the zinc citrate without requiring them to take it along with food. The results were compared to how well zinc gulconate and zinc oxide were absorbed. Zinc citrate was as good as zinc gluconate at being absorbed by the body. Zinc oxide was the worst of the three at being absorbed by the body. Three people did not absorb or barely absorbed any zinc from the zinc oxide. The results show that zinc citrate is as good as zinc gulconate at being absorbed by the human body. It is another good option to prevent lack of zinc in the body and for treating diarrhea. The zinc oxide form is not absorbed as well by the human body when given without food. Some people may not absorb any zinc at all or may barely absorb any.
Zinc supplements help with some problems, such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD), an eye disease that can blur vision. How much zinc gets into the body may depend on the form in which zinc is taken. We compared the movement of zinc in the body after taking zinc gluconate or zinc oxide. 12 healthy males 21 to 31 years old took zinc gluconate and zinc oxide for 14 days each, waiting for at least 14 days between switching to the other supplement. Zinc levels were measured in their blood. The highest level of zinc in the blood was higher for zinc gluconate as compared to zinc oxide. The levels of zinc in the blood were higher after zinc was given as zinc gluconate when compared to zinc oxide, but the time it took to reach the highest levels was the same. Getting zinc into human bodies could be improved by using zinc gluconate.
Extra zinc is good for conditions like eye diseases that cause loss of sight. Research suggests that how much zinc is absorbed by the body is affected by the form of the zinc taken. This study compares using two different forms of zinc, zinc gluconate and zinc oxide. This study included men ages 21 to 31. They received one type of zinc pills for two weeks, then the other form of zinc pills for two weeks with a two week break between the sets. The maximum amount of zinc in the blood was higher after taking zinc gluconate than when taking zinc oxide. The amount of zinc in the blood over a day was higher when taking zinc gluconate than when taking zinc oxide. However the time it took to be at max zinc was the same for both forms of zinc. In conclusion, people absorb zinc better when it is in the zinc gluconate form.
Zinc is considered to get into the body easily when taken as yeast enriched with zinc or zinc gluconate. These two supplements have not been compared to each other. We study if zinc gets into the body of healthy male volunteers better when given with yeast compared to zinc gluconate. The volunteers took the two supplements sequentially, in no particular order. We examined urine, blood and stools over 48 hours after volunteers took a single dose of supplement. We measured the total amount of zinc and its availability in the body. There was no difference in getting the two supplements out of the body through urine. There was more zinc in the blood in the first six hours after taking zinc gluconate, but more of it was removed with the stools. Zinc yeast also increased in blood with time but was removed less with the stools. The amount of zinc in the body 48 hours after taking zinc yeast was high, but after zinc gluconate the body lost more zinc than it had before. Organic zinc yeast supplements provide the body with more zinc than the zinc gluconate salts.
Yeast with added zinc and the supplement zinc gluconate are two of the best options to get more zinc in your body. Hardly any research exists comparing the two supplements. This study wanted to see which supplement was better in healthy men. Researchers collected urine, blood, and poop samples over two days after the men took one dose of the supplement. The researchers calculated the amount of zinc in the body in multiple ways. The researchers found no differences in the amount of zinc lost from urinating. Men had higher amounts of zinc in the blood during the first 6 hours after taking it, but lost more zinc from poop. Men also had higher zinc in the blood after taking the yeast with zinc. However, men lost a lot less zinc through poop. The results show that the zinc gluconate supplement may result in a loss of zinc in the body. In conclusion, the yeast with zinc supplement gave the body more zinc than the zinc gluconate supplement.
Unlike iron, zinc gets into the body proportionately to taking it in with food, not depending on zinc presence in the body. As the amount of zinc in the food increases, the total amount of zinc that the body takes in increases, while the proportion of zinc that the body takes in goes down. The digestive system maintains the balance of zinc in the body by adjusting how much zinc it removes from the body while taking in zinc from the food. If the amount of zinc in food is below 9 milligrams a day, the body uses special chemicals to take zinc into the body. The process of taking in zinc does not depend on how much zinc the body took in the past or currently has. Instead, zinc consumed with food determines how much zinc will get into the body. Zinc supplements taken with water get into the body more efficiently than food zinc. This efficiency goes down within 24 hours, maybe because the body slows down the special chemicals that take zinc in. 
The amount of zinc a person's body absorbs is affected by the amount of zinc a person takes in through food or supplements. The body absorbs more zinc when zinc is larger part of a person's diet. The percentage of zinc absorbed by the body is less however. The body's digestive system makes sure that the body has the zinc it needs by absorbing enough zinc to make up for what the body has lost. Zinc is absorbed in the body through special proteins when 9mg or less is gotten in a day. There is no evidence that the amount of zinc a person had in the past affects the way zinc is absorbed in the body now. The amount of zinc a person takes in now is what mainly affects the absorption of zinc. The zinc in zinc supplements is better absorbed than zinc brought into the body by food. The different in absorption disappears within 24 hours though. More research needs to be done to understand how the body absorbs zinc in different situations.
Zinc is now believed to be an extremely important micronutrient. Micronutrients are vitamins and minerals that are needed for healthy development, disease prevention, and wellbeing. The body maintains the balance of zinc through special chemicals that take the zinc into cells according to needs. How much and how well zinc is taken into the body depends on its amount in the food and other factors. Other factors are age and the time over which zinc is ingested. There is no difference between the ways zinc from supplements and the meals are taken into the body. The foods, such as grains, which contain phytates, chemicals that prevent minerals from getting into the body, may prevent zinc from getting into the body. Models show that the majority of differences in how much zinc will get into the body is due to the presence of zinc and phytate in the food. Our model shows that an adult body takes in about 6 milligrams a day. If the daily meals contain a gram of phytate, twice the recommended daily amount of zinc is needed. Zinc is removed with stools depending on how much zinc the body took in and how much was present. The relation between zinc that is taken in and removed determines how much zinc should be taken. Phytate might play a role on how much zinc that is already in the body is removed with stools. This role is probably not as important as in preventing zinc in the food from getting into the body. 
Doctors have realized recently that zinc is very important to health. The cells in the intestines keep the body's zinc level balanced. Many factors determine how much and how well zinc is absorbed by the body. The most important factor is the amount of zinc a person gets. Two other factors are a person's age and the length of time zinc is taken. The amount of zinc absorbed by the body is not different whether the zinc comes from supplements like pills or from food. Some compounds found in certain foods can make it harder for the body to absorb zinc. The body absorbs zinc differently depending on the amount of zinc or the amount of phytate in the amount already. The results were added to previous data and now we know that adults can absorb at most 6mg of zinc a day. A person needs to take double the normal amount of zinc if getting 1000mg of phytate through food and medication. The body gets rid of zinc according to how much zinc is already in the body and how much has been absorbed recently. How much zinc is lost and how much is absorbed is important to know so that people get the right amount of zinc. The way that phylate affects how much zinc is removed from the body needs to be looked at more. But that effect is probably not as important as the way phylate affects how much zinc gets absorbed in the body.
Iron is a necessary nutrient for many metabolic processes in almost all living organisms. During infections, a battle for iron takes place between the human and disease-causing organisms (pathogens). The liver protein hepcidin, which is linked to defensins (bacteria-fighting proteins of the immune system), plays an important role by taking iron from pathogens by moving iron into human cells, mainly immune cells. While this event is well known in certain bacterial infections, much less is known about viral infections. Iron metabolism may also affect the function of cells of the immune system. Once stimulated by touching cells with parts of foreign organisms attached to them, immune cells need iron to sustain the energy needed for an effective cellular and immune response. The COVID-19 pandemic (caused by a virus causing a lung infection) has boosted clinical and medical research over the possible influences of nutrients on SARS-CoV-2 infection, in terms of either contracting or aiding the infection. Here we review the links between iron metabolism and COVID-19, belonging to the wider field of study of the so-called "nutritional immunity". A better understanding of these links may help develop more effective strategies for managing COVID-19 and possible future pandemics.
The background of this study is that iron is a necessary element to almost all living beings. The delicate balance between host immune system and viral growth plays an important role in infections. The link between iron metabolism and recovery from COVID-19 (a viral lung infection) remains poorly understood. We aimed to estimate the links between full-body iron metabolism with the severity and risks of side effects in COVID-19. In this clinical study, we included 158 confirmed COVID-19 patients in Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, China (27 January to 5 April, 2020). Basic background data, other diseases, lab tests, treatments, and clinical results were all collected. A specific mathematical test was used to estimate the links between iron levels with the severity and risks of side effects in COVID-19 patients. As a result, we identified 60 (38%) severe cases in 158 COVID-19 patients. The average age was 63 years, and the average length of hospital stay was 28 days. After adjusting for age, sex, immune signals, and pre-existing diseases, all iron measures were linked with the severity of COVID-19 for blood iron and iron-containing proteins. These iron measures were also linked to the risk of a serious lung condition that leads to low blood oxygen, excessive bleeding or clotting, immediate heart-related injury, immediate liver injury, and immediate kidney injury in COVID-19 patients and high immune signal levels. In conclusion, patients with low blood iron likely suffered from severe effects of and multiple-organ injury in COVID-19. The iron metabolism measures might be risk factors and clinical markers for COVID-19 recovery.
Large changes in COVID-19 (a viral lung infection) disease progression urges the need to find the most relevant markers to predict patients' outcomes. We tested iron metabolism and immune response in 303 patients of the main hospital of the northern region of Portugal with different clinical needs, from September to November 2020. One hundred and twenty-seven had SARS-CoV-2 and 176 did not. Iron-related lab measures and immune signaling molecules were measured in blood samples collected soon after admission. Basic background data, other diseases, and clinical results were recorded. Patients were assigned into five groups according to severity. Blood iron and transferrin (an iron-containing protein) levels at admission were lower in patients with COVID-19 than those without. The levels of interleukin (IL)-6 and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) (certain immune signaling molecules) were increased in patients with COVID-19. The lowest blood iron and transferrin levels at diagnosis were linked with the worst outcomes. Iron levels were lower with higher IL-6. Higher levels of this immune signaling molecule were linked with a worse recovery. Blood ferritin (iron-containing protein) levels at diagnosis were higher in patients with COVID-19 than those without. Blood iron is the simplest lab test to be used as a predictor of disease progression in COVID-19 patients.
This report talks about dual roles of blood ferritin (an iron-containing protein) as a measure of both iron status and inflammation (an infection-fighting process in the body). We suggest benefits of a lower range of blood ferritin like with total blood cholesterol and fasting blood sugar levels. Studying phlebotomy (vein puncturing) in patients with peripheral arterial disease (blockage of veins to the blood) offered unique insights into dual roles of blood ferritin both as an iron status marker and inflammation marker. We found links between higher blood ferritin, higher interleukin 6 [IL-6] and tissue necrosis factor-alpha (immune signaling molecules), and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (a marker of inflammation). Increased blood ferritin and IL-6 levels were linked with increased death rates and with reduced death rates at low ferritin levels. Other large-population studies show similar results. Extremely increased ferritin and IL-6 levels also occur in individuals with high death risks due to SARS-CoV-2 infection (infection from a virus causing a lung disease). Disordered iron metabolism seen in a high range of blood ferritin level signals disease severity and results. Based upon experiments and large patient group data, we suggest testing the idea that optimal ferritin levels for heart-related death rate reduction range from 20 to 100 ng/mL with % transferrin levels from 20 to 50%. This is to ensure a healthy iron status and that ferritin levels above 194 ng/mL link with all-cause death risk in patient groups.
While it took decades to learn that ferritin (an iron-containing protein) is more than a marker of iron storage level, it took some time during the COVID-19 pandemic (a pandemic caused by a virus that causes lung infections) to wonder why there are high levels of ferritin in patients with severe COVID-19. Unsurprisingly, inflammation markers were not a satisfactory explanation. Also, how ferritin acts in patients with severe COVID-19 and the resulting high death rates in patients with high ferritin levels forced further studies to understand the role of ferritin in the diseases. Ferritin was at first described to accompany many immediate infections, both viral and bacterial, indicating an immediate response to inflammation. However, with hyperferritinemic syndrome (high ferritin levels) linking four severe disease conditions such as adult-onset Still's disease, macrophage activation syndrome, catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome, and septic shock (immune- or infection-related diseases) added another aspect of ferritin where it could have a disease-causing role rather than an extremely increased protein only. In fact, suggesting that COVID-19 is a new member in the range of hyperferritinemic syndrome besides the four mentioned conditions could hopefully direct further search on the disease-causing role of ferritin. Without doubt, improving our understanding of those aspects of ferritin would enormously contribute to better treatment and side effect management with severe diseases. We present the origin, history, importance, and the advances of searching the role of ferritin in various disease-causing and clinical processes in our article. Also, the possibilities of ferritin in COVID-19 are addressed.
SARS-CoV-2 infection (a viral lung infection) can cause effects ranging from patients with no symptoms to life-threatening conditions. Severe COVID-19 patients often display a severe lung effect and develop altered levels of immune cells and strikingly increased levels of IL-6 (an immune signaling molecule called a cytokine). There is an increased cytokine release with hyperferritinemia (high levels of ferritin - an iron-containing protein). This leads to the idea that COVID-19 is part of the hyperferritinemic syndrome disease group. Indeed, very high levels of ferritin can occur in other diseases including hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, macrophage activation syndrome, adult-onset Still's disease, catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome and septic shock (immune- or infection-related diseases). Many studies have shown the immune-system-regulating effects of ferritin and its links with death risks and high inflammation. High levels of free iron are harmful in the body, especially through damage that can lead to scarring. Iron binding represents a pillar in the treatment of iron overload. Also, it was proven to have an anti-viral and anti-scarring activity. Herein, we analyse the disease-causing role of ferritin and iron during SARS-CoV-2 infection and propose iron depletion treatment as a new treatment in the COVID-19 pandemic.
As background for this article, several studies have suggested that COVID-19 (a viral lung infection) is a full-body disease that can affect several organs, including the brain. In the brain, specifically, viral infection can cause imbalances of some nutrients that promote complex biochemical reactions in certain brain functions. The study's objective is to understand the disease-causing ability of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus causing COVID-19) in the brain and the link between certain nutrients and brain disorders after infection. The objective is also to provide new insights on the drug creation for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Databases were used to search studies published up September 2021, focusing on the role of specific elements during viral infection and on the correct functioning of the brain. The imbalance of important elements can increase SARS-CoV-2 effects in the brain and increase the damage to the brain since many brain processes can be linked with the balance of metal and metal-carrying proteins. Some studies involving animals and humans have suggested the link between brain cells as a vulnerable region of the brain to brain disorders after viral infection. Considering all the evidence, some mechanisms have been suggested to understand the link between brain disorders and imbalance of specific elements in the brain after viral infection. In conclusion, certain elements play important roles in viral infections, such as helping to activate immune cells, produce antibodies that fight infections, and block virus growth. However, the link between specific elements and virus infections is complex since the specific functions of several elements is largely unknown. Thus, there is much to be explored to understand the biochemical processes involved between specific elements and viral infections, especially in the brain.
The importance of ferritin (an iron-containing protein) as an inflammatory marker is well known. However, it is unknown whether this differs between Covid-19 (a viral lung infection) and non-Covid-19 patients. The blood levels of ferritin, white blood cells (WBC - specific immune cells), C-reactive protein (CRP - a marker of inflammation), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH; an enzyme that helps make energy) may all be measured to check whether there is a difference. The researchers want to see if the inflammatory process changes between these two kinds. Blood samples were collected from 119 COVID-19 patients in the hospital and 50 healthy persons. Corona virus (which causes COVID-19) was discovered when a nose swab was collected and tested for fragments of the virus. Ferritin, LDH, WBC, and CRP were also tested in that sequence. The study revealed that COVID-19 patients had higher levels of ferritin, WBC, CRP, and LDH in their blood than healthy people. From the existing data, males are more likely to be infected with COVID-19 (81%) than females (32%). Females had greater ferritin, CRP, WBC, and LDH levels than males. Because they are related to a test for predicting COVID-19 infection, the recommended cut-off values for ferritin, WBC, CRP, and LDH are 109.8 ng/mL, 14.9109/L, 10.15 mg/L, and 229.33 U/L, respectively. Finally, an increase in ferritin levels in the inflammatory response to COVID-19 is linked to an increase in inflammatory markers including CRP, WBC, and LDH. This understanding may assist in the identification of COVID-19 infection.
Ferritin (an iron-containing protein), which has 24 light and heavy parts in varying proportions in different tissues, is primarily responsible for maintaining the body's iron metabolism. Its normal value is between 10 and 200 ngmL-1 in men and between 30-300 ngmL-1 in women. Iron is delivered to the tissue via them, and they act as immune-system-regulators, signaling molecules, and inflammatory markers. When ferritin level exceeds 1000 µgL-1, the patient is categorized as having hyperferritinemia (high ferritin levels). Iron binders such as deferiprone, deferirox, and deferoxamine are currently FDA approved to treat iron overload (or high levels of iron). The inflammation process and poor recovery of COVID-19 (a viral lung infection) may be linked to high ferritin levels. Critically ill patients can benefit from deferasirox, an iron binder given by mouth at 20-40 mgkg-1 once daily, as well as deferoxamine initially given at 1000 mg in the vein followed by 500 mg every 4 to 12 hours. It can be combined with antibodies (immune system products to fight infections), antioxidants, corticosteroids (specific steroids), and lactoferrin (a protein in mammalian milk) to make iron binding treatment effective for COVID-19 victims. In this article, we analyze the antiviral and antiscarring activity of iron binders, thereby promoting iron depletion therapy as a possibly new treatment for COVID-19.
During infections, the human moves around iron in order to starve disease-causing molecules (pathogens) from this nutrient. Several proteins are involved in iron absorption, transport, and storage. Ferritin is the most important iron storage protein. It is made up of different amounts of two proteins, the L- and H-ferritins (FTL and FTH). We previously showed that macrophages (specific immune cells) increase their amount of FTH1 when they are infected as cells in a test tube with Mycobacterium avium (bacteria related to tuberculosis), without a significant increase in FTL. In this work, we tested the role of macrophage FTH1 in M. avium infection as cells in a living organism. We found that mice low in FTH1 in myeloid cells (specific bone marrow cells) are more resistant to M. avium infection. They have lower bacterial amounts and lower levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (infection signaling molecules) than normal mice, due to the lower levels of available iron in their bodies. Importantly, we also found that FTH1 made by myeloid cells due to infection may be found in blood and that it plays a key role in iron redistribution. Specifically, without FTH1 in myeloid cells, increased amounts of ferroportin (iron-transporting proteins) is observed in liver granulomas (small areas of inflammation) and increased iron storage occurs in liver cells. These results show the importance of FTH1 in myeloid cells for iron redistribution during infection.
