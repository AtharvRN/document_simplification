<REPHRASE> A striptease is an erotic or exotic dance in which the performer gradually undresses, either partly or completely, in a seductive and sexually suggestive manner. <REPHRASE> The person who performs a striptease is commonly known as a "stripper" or exotic dancer. <SPLIT> There is a stripping aspect in the ancient Sumerian myth of the descent of the goddess Inanna into the Underworld (or Kur). <COPY> At each of the seven gates, she removed an article of clothing or a piece of jewelry. <REPHRASE> As long as she remained in hell, the earth was barren. <DELETE> When she returned, fecundity abounded. <DELETE> Some believe this myth was embodied in the dance of the seven veils of Salome, who danced for King Herod, as mentioned in the New Testament in Matthew 14:6 and Mark 6:21-22. <DELETE> However, although the Bible records Salome's dance, the first mention of her removing seven veils occurs in Oscar Wilde's play of 'Salome', in 1893. <REPHRASE> In ancient Greece, the lawgiver Solon established several classes of prostitutes in the late 6th century BC. <SPLIT> Among these classes of prostitutes were the auletrides: female dancers, acrobats, and musicians, noted for dancing naked in an alluring fashion in front of audiences of men. <SPLIT> In ancient Rome, dance featuring stripping was part of the entertainments "(ludi)" at the Floralia, an April festival in honor of the goddess Flora. <SPLIT> Empress Theodora, wife of 6th-century Byzantine emperor Justinian is reported by several ancient sources to have started in life as a courtesan and actress who performed in acts inspired from mythological themes and in which she disrobed "as far as the laws of the day allowed". <REPHRASE> She was famous for her striptease performance of "Leda and the Swan". <DELETE> From these accounts, it appears that the practice was hardly exceptional nor new. <DELETE> It was, however, actively opposed by the Christian Church, which succeeded in obtaining statutes banning it in the following century. <DELETE> The degree to which these statutes were subsequently enforced is, of course, opened to question. <REPHRASE> What is certain is that no practice of the sort is reported in texts of the European Middle Ages. <REPHRASE> Some claim the origin of the modern striptease lies in Oscar Wilde's play of 'Salome', in 1893. <SPLIT> In the Dance of the Seven Veils the female protagonist dances for King Herod and slowly removes her veils until she lies naked. <REPHRASE> After Wilde's play and Richard Strauss's operatic version of the same, first performed in 1905, the erotic 'dance of the seven veils', became a standard routine for dancers in opera, vaudeville, film and burlesque. <SPLIT> A famous early practitioner was Maud Allan who in 1907 gave a private performance of the dance to King Edward VII. <REPHRASE> In the 1880s and 1890s, Parisian shows such as the Moulin Rouge and Folies Bergère were featuring attractive scantily clad women dancing and tableaux vivants. <DELETE> In this environment, an act in the 1890s featured a woman who slowly removed her clothes in a vain search for a flea crawling on her body. <REPHRASE> "The People's Almanac" credits the act as the origin of modern striptease. <DELETE> In 1905, the notorious and tragic Dutch dancer Mata Hari, later shot as a spy by the French authorities during World War I, was an overnight success from the debut of her act at the Musée Guimet. <DELETE> The most celebrated segment of her act was her progressive shedding of clothing until she wore just a jeweled bra and some ornaments over her arms and head. <DELETE> Another landmark performance was the appearance at the Moulin Rouge in 1907 of an actress called Germaine Aymos, who entered dressed only in three very small shells. <DELETE> In the 1920s and 1930s the famous Josephine Baker danced topless in the "danse sauvage" at the Folies and other such performances were provided at the Tabarin. <SPLIT> These shows were notable for their sophisticated choreography and often dressing the girls in glitzy sequins and feathers. <DELETE> In his 1957 book "Mythologies", semiotician Roland Barthes interpreted this Parisian striptease as a "mystifying spectacle", a "reassuring ritual" where "evil is advertised the better to impede and exorcise it". <REPHRASE> By the 1960s "fully nude" shows were provided at such places as Le Crazy Horse Saloon. <REPHRASE> Also produced in 1965 was "Carousella", a documentary about Soho striptease artistes, directed by John Irvin. <REPHRASE> Another documentary film, which looked at the unglamorous side of striptease, is the 1966 film called,"Strip", filmed at the Phoenix Club in Soho. <SPLIT> "Secrets of a Windmill Girl" (1966) featured Pauline Collins and April Wilding and was directed by Arnold L.

<DELETE> The Kippax was one of the best known and vocally active terraced stands at Manchester City's Maine Road ground. <REPHRASE> Originally the Popular Side when the stadium opened in 1923, its name was changed in 1956 when the club gained planning permission to build a roof to shield fans from the rain. <REPHRASE> It was named after Kippax Street which ran along this side of the ground. <DELETE> The Kippax was unusual in that, unlike at most other grounds, it occupied a full side rather than an end of the ground as with goal end terraces like Liverpool's Kop, Manchester United's Stretford End, Everton's Gwladys Street, Newcastle United's Gallowgate or Aston Villa's Holte End. <SPLIT> In the summer of 1994, due to the Taylor Report, the Kippax was demolished. <REPHRASE> A new all seater stand was built in its place and opened by City legend Bert Trautmann in October 1995. <REPHRASE> It housed 10,178 seated fans, had three tiers and was at the time the highest stand in the country. <DELETE> The club left Maine Road in May 2003 and relocated to the City of Manchester Stadium. <REPHRASE> The old stadium was demolished in early 2004. <REPHRASE> Unofficially, the East Stand at the new stadium is also called The Kippax.
<DELETE> Classical mechanics describes the motion of macroscopic objects, from projectiles to parts of machinery, and astronomical objects, such as spacecraft, planets, stars and galaxies. <DELETE> If the present state of an object is known it is possible to predict by the laws of classical mechanics how it will move in the future (determinism) and how it has moved in the past (reversibility). <REPHRASE> Classical mechanics uses common-sense notions of how matter and forces exist and interact. <REPHRASE> It assumes that matter and energy have definite, knowable attributes such as location in space and speed. <DELETE> Non-relativistic mechanics also assumes that forces act instantaneously (see also Action at a distance). <REPHRASE> Acceleration represents the velocity's change over time. <REPHRASE> Velocity can change in either magnitude or direction, or both. <SPLIT> Occasionally, a decrease in the magnitude of velocity ""v"" is referred to as "deceleration", but generally any change in the velocity over time, including deceleration, is simply referred to as acceleration. <REPHRASE> The quantity "m"v is called the (canonical) momentum. <COPY> The net force on a particle is thus equal to the rate of change of the momentum of the particle with time. <SPLIT> Newton founded his principles of natural philosophy on three proposed laws of motion: the law of inertia, his second law of acceleration (mentioned above), and the law of action and reaction; and hence laid the foundations for classical mechanics. <SPLIT> Both Newton's second and third laws were given the proper scientific and mathematical treatment in Newton's "Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica."

<SPLIT> Hernandez v. Texas, 347 U.S. 475 (1954), was a landmark case, "the first and only Mexican-American civil-rights case heard and decided by the United States Supreme Court during the post-World War II period." <REPHRASE> In a unanimous ruling, the court held that Mexican Americans and all other nationality groups in the United States have equal protection under the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. <REPHRASE> The ruling was written by Justice Earl Warren. <REPHRASE> This was the first case in which Mexican-American lawyers had appeared before the US Supreme Court. <SPLIT> Peter Hernandez, a Mexican-American agricultural worker, was convicted for the 1951 murder of Joe Espinosa. <SPLIT> Hernandez's "pro bono" legal team, including Gustavo C. García, wanted to challenge what they knew was "the systematic exclusion of persons of Mexican origin from all types of jury duty in at least seventy counties in Texas." <DELETE> They appealed Hernandez's conviction claiming that Mexican Americans were treated as a class apart and subject to social discrimination in Jackson County, where the case had been tried. <REPHRASE> They were systematically excluded from the grand jury and jury. <SPLIT> Hernandez's defense lawyers demonstrated that, although numerous Mexican Americans were citizens and had otherwise qualified for jury duty in Jackson County, during the previous 25 years no Mexican Americans (or, more precisely, no one with a Hispanic surname) were among the 6,000 persons chosen to serve on juries. <DELETE> This resulted in Hernandez having been deprived of equal protection of the law under the Fourteenth Amendment, as juries were restricted by ethnicity. <COPY> Hernandez and his lawyers appealed to the Texas Supreme Court. <DELETE> They appealed to the United States Supreme Court through a writ of certiorari. <REPHRASE> The legal team included García, Carlos Cadena and John J. Herrera of the League of United Latin American Citizens, and James DeAnda and Cris Alderete of the G. I. Forum, both activist groups for civil rights for Mexican Americans. <REPHRASE> These were the first Mexican-American lawyers to represent a defendant before the US Supreme Court, which heard their arguments on January 11, 1954. <SPLIT> Chief Justice Earl Warren and the rest of the Supreme Court unanimously ruled in favor of Hernandez, and required he be retried by a jury composed without discrimination against Mexican Americans. <DELETE> The Court held that the Fourteenth Amendment protects persons beyond the racial classes of white or black, and extends protection to nationality groups as well. <DELETE> The ruling was an extension of protection in the Civil Rights Movement to nationality groups within the country and an acknowledgement that, in certain times and places, groups other than blacks (African Americans) could be discriminated against. <SPLIT> The ultimate effect of this ruling was that the protection of the 14th Amendment was ruled to cover any national or ethnic groups of the United States for which discrimination could be proved.

<REPHRASE> An arch bridge is a bridge with abutments at each end shaped as a curved arch. <DELETE> Arch bridges work by transferring the weight of the bridge and its loads partially into a horizontal thrust restrained by the abutments at either side. <DELETE> A viaduct (a long bridge) may be made from a series of arches, although other more economical structures are typically used today. <REPHRASE> Possibly the oldest existing arch bridge is the Mycenaean Arkadiko Bridge in Greece from about 1300 BC. <REPHRASE> The stone corbel arch bridge is still used by the local populace. <REPHRASE> The well-preserved Hellenistic Eleutherna Bridge has a triangular corbel arch. <REPHRASE> The 4th century BC Rhodes Footbridge rests on an early voussoir arch. <SPLIT> Although true arches were already known by the Etruscans and ancient Greeks, the Romans were – as with the vault and the dome – the first to fully realize the potential of arches for bridge construction. <SPLIT> A list of Roman bridges compiled by the engineer Colin O'Connor features 330 Roman stone bridges for traffic, 34 Roman timber bridges and 54 Roman aqueduct bridges, a substantial part still standing and even used to carry vehicles. <SPLIT> A more complete survey by the Italian scholar Vittorio Galliazzo found 931 Roman bridges, mostly of stone, in as many as 26 different countries (including former Yugoslavia). <REPHRASE> Roman arch bridges were usually semicircular, although a number were segmental arch bridges (such as Alconétar Bridge), a bridge which has a curved arch that is less than a semicircle. <SPLIT> The advantages of the segmental arch bridge were that it allowed great amounts of flood water to pass under it, which would prevent the bridge from being swept away during floods and the bridge itself could be more lightweight. <SPLIT> Generally, Roman bridges featured wedge-shaped primary arch stones (voussoirs) of the same in size and shape. <DELETE> The Romans built both single spans and lengthy multiple arch aqueducts, such as the Pont du Gard and Segovia Aqueduct. <SPLIT> Their bridges featured from an early time onwards flood openings in the piers, e.g. in the Pons Fabricius in Rome (62 BC), one of the world's oldest major bridges still standing. <REPHRASE> The Romans also introduced segmental arch bridges into bridge construction. <SPLIT> The 330 m Limyra Bridge in southwestern Turkey features 26 segmental arches with an average span-to-rise ratio of 5.3:1, giving the bridge an unusually flat profile unsurpassed for more than a millennium. <REPHRASE> Trajan's bridge over the Danube featured open-spandrel segmental arches made of wood (standing on 40 m concrete piers). <REPHRASE> This was to be the longest arch bridge for a thousand years both in terms of overall and individual span length, while the longest extant Roman bridge is the 790 m long Puente Romano at Mérida. <REPHRASE> The late Roman Karamagara Bridge in Cappadocia may represent the earliest surviving bridge featuring a pointed arch. <SPLIT> In medieval Europe, bridge builders improved on the Roman structures by using narrower piers, thinner arch barrels and higher span to rise ratios on bridges. <DELETE> Gothic pointed arches were also introduced, reducing lateral thrust, and spans increased as with the eccentric Puente del Diablo (1282). <COPY> The 14th century in particular saw bridge building reaching new heights. <SPLIT> Span lengths of 40 m , previously unheard of in the history of masonry arch construction, were now reached in places as diverse as Spain (Puente de San Martín), Italy (Castelvecchio Bridge) and France (Devil's bridge and Pont Grand) and with arch types as different as semi-circular, pointed and segmental arches. <SPLIT> The bridge at Trezzo sull'Adda, destroyed in the 15th century, even featured a span length of 72 m , not matched until 1796. <REPHRASE> Stone, brick and other such materials are strong in compression and somewhat so in shear, but cannot resist much force in tension. <REPHRASE> As a result, masonry arch bridges are designed to be constantly under compression, so far as is possible. <REPHRASE> Each arch is constructed over a temporary falsework frame, known as a centring. <SPLIT> In the first compression arch bridges, a keystone in the middle of the bridge bore the weight of the rest of the bridge. <COPY> The more weight that was put onto the bridge, the stronger its structure became. <SPLIT> Masonry arch bridges use a quantity of fill material (typically compacted rubble) above the arch in order to increase this dead-weight on the bridge and prevent tension from occurring in the arch ring as loads move across the bridge. <COPY> Other materials that were used to build this type of bridge were brick and unreinforced concrete. <SPLIT> When masonry (cut stone) is used the angles of the faces are cut to minimize shear forces. <SPLIT> Where random masonry (uncut and unprepared stones) is used they are mortared together and the mortar is allowed to set before the falsework is removed.

<SPLIT> A syllogism (Greek: "syllogismos", "conclusion, inference") is a kind of logical argument that applies deductive reasoning to arrive at a conclusion based on two or more propositions that are asserted or assumed to be true. <REPHRASE> In antiquity, two rival theories of the syllogism existed: Aristotelian syllogistic and Stoic syllogistic. <DELETE> Aristotle defines the syllogism as "a discourse in which certain (specific) things having been supposed, something different from the things supposed results of necessity because these things are so". <DELETE> Despite this very general definition, in "Prior Analytics" Aristotle limits himself to categorical syllogisms that consist of three categorical propositions. <DELETE> These include categorical modal syllogisms. <REPHRASE> Within academic contexts, the syllogism was superseded by first-order predicate logic following the work of Gottlob Frege, in particular his "Begriffsschrift" ("Concept Script") (1879), but syllogisms remain useful in some circumstances, and for general-audience introductions to logic. <DELETE> Each of the three distinct terms represents a category. <COPY> In the above example, "humans", "mortal", and "Greeks". <DELETE> "Mortal" is the major term, "Greeks" the minor term. <SPLIT> The premises also have one term in common with each other, which is known as the "middle term"; in this example, "humans". <REPHRASE> Both of the premises are universal, as is the conclusion. <DELETE> Here, the major term is "die", the minor term is "men", and the middle term is "mortals". <SPLIT> Again, both premises are universal, hence so is the conclusion. <DELETE> A sorites is a form of argument in which a series of incomplete syllogisms is so arranged that the predicate of each premise forms the subject of the next until the subject of the first is joined with the predicate of the last in the conclusion. <SPLIT> For example, one might argue that all lions are big cats, all big cats are predators, and all predators are carnivores. <DELETE> To conclude that therefore all lions are carnivores is to construct a sorites argument.

<SPLIT> Castration (also known as orchidectomy) is any action, surgical, chemical, or otherwise, by which an individual loses use of the testicles: the male gonad. <DELETE> Surgical castration is bilateral orchidectomy (excision of both testes), and chemical castration uses pharmaceutical drugs to deactivate the testes. <REPHRASE> Castration causes sterilization (preventing the castrated person or animal from reproducing); it also greatly reduces the production of certain hormones, such as testosterone. <REPHRASE> Surgical castration in animals is often called neutering. <SPLIT> Castration was frequently used for religious or social reasons in certain cultures in Europe, South Asia, Africa, and East Asia. <DELETE> After battles in some cases, winners castrated their captives or the corpses of the defeated to symbolize their victory and seize their "power". <DELETE> Castrated men — eunuchs – were often admitted to special social classes and were used particularly to staff bureaucracies and palace households: in particular, the harem. <DELETE> Castration also figured in a number of religious castration cults. <REPHRASE> Other religions, such as Judaism, were strongly opposed to the practice. <SPLIT> The Leviticus Holiness code, for example, specifically excludes eunuchs or any males with defective genitals from the priesthood, just as castrated animals are excluded from sacrifice. <REPHRASE> Eunuchs in China had been known to usurp power in many eras of Chinese history, most notably in the Later Han, late Tang and late Ming dynasties. <DELETE> There are similar recorded Middle Eastern events. <SPLIT> Either surgical removal of both testicles or chemical castration may be carried out in the case of prostate cancer. <DELETE> Testosterone-depletion treatment (either surgical removal of both testicles or chemical castration) is used to slow down the cancer, greatly reduce sex drive or interest in those with sexual drives, obsessions, or behaviors, or any combination of those that may be considered deviant. <SPLIT> Edward Gibbon's "Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire" reports castration of defeated foes at the hands of the Normans during their invasions of Sicily and Italy. <SPLIT> During the reign of Mu of the Zhou Dynasty (10th c. BCE) the Minister of Crime, Marquis Lu, reformed the law in 950 BC to make it easier for people to be sentenced to castration instead of death. <SPLIT> As long as the practice existed in China, not only were the testicles merely removed but castration included the severing of one's entire genitalia. <COPY> Both organs were cut off with a knife at the same time. <SPLIT> In Europe, when women were not permitted to sing in church or cathedral choirs in the Roman Catholic Church, boys were castrated to develop a special high voice and to prevent their voices breaking at puberty. <REPHRASE> The first documents mentioning "castrati" are Italian church records from the 1550s. <REPHRASE> In the baroque and classical music eras these singers were highly appreciated by opera composers as well. <SPLIT> Mozart's "Exultate Jubilate", Allegri's "Miserere" and other pieces from this period now sung by sopranos and countertenors were written for "castrati". <REPHRASE> Some of the alto parts of Handel's Messiah were first sung by a "castrato". <REPHRASE> "Castrati" include Farinelli, Senesino, Carestini, and Caffarelli. <REPHRASE> The last true "castrato" was Alessandro Moreschi (1858–1922) who served in the Sistine Chapel Choir. <REPHRASE> It was not until the late 19th century that the Roman Catholic Church officially condemned the production of "castrati". <REPHRASE> In Modern times, the Mexican Javier Medina is the only professional opera singer that can perform as a castrato, since he suffered from an involuntary chemical castration, as a result from a cancer treatment that he had before he reached puberty. <REPHRASE> Humans commonly castrate domestic animals not intended for breeding. <SPLIT> Domestic animals are usually castrated to avoid unwanted or uncontrolled reproduction; to reduce or prevent other manifestations of sexual behaviour such as defending the herd from humans and other threats, or intra-herd aggression (e.g. fighting between groups of entire (uncastrated) males of a species); or to reduce other consequences of sexual behavior that may make animal husbandry more difficult, such as boundary/fence/enclosure destruction when attempting to get to nearby females of the species. <REPHRASE> Male horses are usually castrated (gelded) using emasculators, because stallions are rather aggressive and troublesome. <REPHRASE> The same applies to male mules, although they are sterile. <DELETE> Male cattle are castrated to improve fattening and docility in feedlots or for use as oxen. <REPHRASE> Breeding individuals are kept entire and used for breeding: they may fetch higher prices when sold.

<REPHRASE> Hans Guido Freiherr von Bülow (January 8, 1830February 12, 1894) was a German conductor, virtuoso pianist, and composer of the Romantic era. <REPHRASE> As one of the most distinguished conductors of the 19th century, his activity was critical for establishing the successes of several major composers of the time, especially Richard Wagner and Johannes Brahms. <REPHRASE> Alongside Carl Tausig, Bülow was perhaps the most prominent of the early students of Hungarian virtuoso pianist, conductor and composer Franz Liszt—therein performed the first public performance of Liszt's Sonata in B minor in 1857. <REPHRASE> He became acquainted with, fell in love and eventually married Liszt's daughter Cosima, who later left him for Wagner. <SPLIT> Noted for his interpretation of the works of Ludwig van Beethoven, he was one of the earliest European musicians to tour the United States. <REPHRASE> Bülow was born in Dresden, to members of the prominent Bülow family. <REPHRASE> From the age of nine, he was a student of Friedrich Wieck (the father of Clara Schumann). <SPLIT> However, his parents insisted that he study law instead of music, and they sent him to Leipzig. <SPLIT> There he met Franz Liszt, and on hearing some music of Richard Wagner—specifically, the premiere of "Lohengrin" in 1850—he decided to ignore the dictates of his parents and make himself a career in music instead. <REPHRASE> He studied the piano in Leipzig with the famous pedagogue Louis Plaidy. <REPHRASE> He obtained his first conducting job in Zurich, on Wagner's recommendation, in 1850. <REPHRASE> Bülow had a strongly acerbic personality and a loose tongue; this alienated many musicians whom he worked with. <REPHRASE> He was dismissed from his Zurich job for this reason, but at the same time he was beginning to win renown for his ability to conduct new and complex works without a score. <REPHRASE> In 1851, he became a student of Liszt, marrying his daughter Cosima in 1857. <REPHRASE> They had two daughters: Daniela, born in 1860 and Blandina, born in 1863. <REPHRASE> During the 1850s and early 1860s he was active as a pianist, conductor, and writer, and became well known throughout Germany as well as Russia. <REPHRASE> In 1857, he premiered Liszt's Piano Sonata in B minor in Berlin. <REPHRASE> In 1864 he became the Hofkapellmeister in Munich, and it was at this post he achieved his principal renown. <SPLIT> He conducted the premieres of two Wagner operas, "Tristan und Isolde" and "Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg", in 1865 and 1868 respectively; both were immensely successful. <SPLIT> Meanwhile, however, Cosima had been carrying on an affair with Richard Wagner and gave birth to their daughter Isolde in 1865. <COPY> Two years later, they had another daughter, Eva. <REPHRASE> Although Cosima and Wagner's affair was now open knowledge, Bülow still refused to grant his wife a divorce. <SPLIT> Finally, she gave birth to one final child––a son, Siegfried––and it was only then that the conductor at last relented. <REPHRASE> Their divorce was finalized in 1870, after which Cosima and Wagner married. <SPLIT> Bülow never spoke to Wagner again and he did not see his former wife for 11 years afterwards, although he apparently continued to respect the composer on a professional level, as he still conducted his works and mourned Wagner's death in 1883. <COPY> In July 1882 he married the actress Marie Schanzer. <SPLIT> In addition to championing the music of Wagner, Bülow was a supporter of the music of both Brahms and Tchaikovsky. <REPHRASE> He was the soloist in the world premiere of the Tchaikovsky Piano Concerto No. 1 in B-flat minor in Boston in 1875. <SPLIT> He was also a devotee of Frédéric Chopin's music; he came up with epithets for all of Chopin's Opus 28 Preludes, but these have generally fallen into disuse. <REPHRASE> On the other hand, the D-flat major Prelude No. 15 is widely known by his title, the "Raindrop." <SPLIT> He was the first to perform (from memory) the complete cycle of Beethoven's piano sonatas, and with Sigmund Lebert, he co-produced an edition of the sonatas. <REPHRASE> From 1878 to 1880 he was Hofkapellmeister in Hanover but was forced to leave after fighting with a tenor singing the "Knight of the Swan "Schwan"" role in "Lohengrin"; Bülow had called him the "Knight of the Swine "Schwein"". <SPLIT> In 1880 he moved to Meiningen where he took the equivalent post, and where he built the Meiningen Court Orchestra into one of the finest in Germany; among his other demands, he insisted that the musicians learn to play all their parts from memory. <REPHRASE> It was during his five years in Meiningen that he met Richard Strauss (though the meeting actually took place in Berlin). <SPLIT> His first opinion of the young composer was not favorable, but he changed his mind when he was confronted with a sample of Strauss's "Serenade". <REPHRASE> Later on, he used his influence to give Strauss his first regular employment as a conductor. <REPHRASE> Like Strauss, Bülow was attracted to the ideas of Max Stirner, whom he reputedly had known personally. <REPHRASE> In April 1892 Bülow closed his final performance with the Berlin Philharmonic (where he had been serving as Principal Conductor since 1887) with a speech "exalting" the ideas of Stirner. <REPHRASE> Together with John Henry Mackay, Stirner's biographer, he placed a memorial plaque at Stirner's last residence in Berlin. <DELETE> Some of his orchestral innovations included the addition of the five-string bass and the pedal timpani; the pedal timpani have since become standard instruments in the symphony orchestra. <REPHRASE> His accurate, sensitive, and profoundly musical interpretations established him as the prototype of the virtuoso conductors who flourished at a later date. <REPHRASE> He was also an astute and witty musical journalist. <REPHRASE> In the late 1880s he settled in Hamburg, but continued to tour, both conducting and performing on the piano. <REPHRASE> Bülow suffered from chronic neuralgiforme headaches, which were caused by a tumor of the cervical radicular nerves. <SPLIT> After about 1890 his mental and physical health began to fail, and he sought a warmer, drier climate for recovery; he died in a hotel in Cairo, Egypt at the age of 64, only ten months after his final concert performance.

<SPLIT> Adriaen Coorte (ca. 1665 – after 1707) was a Dutch Golden Age painter of still lifes, who signed works between 1683 and 1707. <REPHRASE> He painted small and unpretentious still lifes in a style more typical of the first half of the century, and was "one of the last practitioners of this intimate category". <REPHRASE> Very little is known of his life, but he is assumed to have been born and died in Middelburg. <REPHRASE> He became a pupil of Melchior d'Hondecoeter around 1680 in Amsterdam. <REPHRASE> Hondecoeter is known for repetitions of certain birds in certain poses, and he apparently took on pupils who were set to work copying these into their compositions. <SPLIT> From 1683 he seems to have returned to Middelburg, where he set up a workshop and signed his small, carefully balanced minimalist still lifes. <REPHRASE> He often painted on paper that was glued to a wooden panel. <SPLIT> About 80 signed works by him have been catalogued, and nearly all of them follow the same pattern; small arrangements of fruits, vegetables, or shells on a stone slab, lit from above, with the dark background typical of still lifes earlier in the century. <REPHRASE> Instead of the Chinese or silver vessels favoured by his contemporaries, his tableware is very basic pottery. <REPHRASE> "Objects and light are studied intensely, and are painted with a wondrous tenderness". <SPLIT> Neither his birth nor death date is certain, and archival evidence only exists in Middelburg for his membership in the Guild of St. Luke there from 1695 onwards, when he was fined for selling a painting without being a member of the guild. <DELETE> His works appear frequently in contemporary Middelburg taxation inventories <SPLIT> Coorte was apparently not well known to his contemporaries outside the small city of Middelburg and, like Vermeer a century before, he was almost entirely forgotten until the 1950s, when the Dutch art historian Laurens J. Bol revived his reputation, beginning with an article in 1952, and finally publishing the first monograph and "catalogue raisonné" on Coorte in 1977 ("Adriaen Coorte", Amsterdam). <SPLIT> Bol arranged an exhibition of 35 examples of Coorte's work in 1958 at the Dordrechts Museum, which became a sensation in the Netherlands, with the poets Hans Faverey and Ed Leeflang both being inspired by the paintings. <REPHRASE> In 2003 there was an exhibition at the National Gallery of Art, Washington. <SPLIT> In 2008 a new travelling exhibition was set up; "Ode to Coorte", that was as nearly as successful, making Coorte the most celebrated "rediscovered" Dutch Baroque painter of recent decades. <SPLIT> Testifying to Coorte's recent popularity is the December 1st, 2009 auction of two of his new-found paintings, which each sold for more than ten times the estimated price.

<SPLIT> Heliocentrism is the astronomical model in which the Earth and planets revolve around the Sun at the center of the Solar System. <DELETE> Historically, heliocentrism was opposed to geocentrism, which placed the Earth at the center. <SPLIT> The notion that the Earth revolves around the Sun had been proposed as early as the 3rd century BC by Aristarchus of Samos, but at least in the medieval world, Aristarchus's heliocentrism attracted little attention—possibly because of the loss of scientific works of the Hellenistic Era. <SPLIT> It was not until the 16th century that a mathematical model of a heliocentric system was presented, by the Renaissance mathematician, astronomer, and Catholic cleric Nicolaus Copernicus, leading to the Copernican Revolution. <DELETE> In the following century, Johannes Kepler introduced elliptical orbits, and Galileo Galilei presented supporting observations made using a telescope. <SPLIT> Nicolaus Copernicus in his "De revolutionibus orbium coelestium" ("On the revolution of heavenly spheres", first printed in 1543 in Nuremberg), presented a discussion of a heliocentric model of the universe in much the same way as Ptolemy in the 2nd century had presented his geocentric model in his "Almagest". <REPHRASE> Copernicus discussed the philosophical implications of his proposed system, elaborated it in geometrical detail, used selected astronomical observations to derive the parameters of his model, and wrote astronomical tables which enabled one to compute the past and future positions of the stars and planets.

<REPHRASE> A bike path is a bikeway separated from motorized traffic and dedicated to cycling or shared with pedestrians or other non-motorized users. <SPLIT> In the US a bike path sometimes encompasses "shared use paths", "multi-use path", or "Class III bikeway" is a paved path that has been designated for use by cyclists outside the right of way of a public road. <REPHRASE> It may or may not have a center divider or stripe to prevent head-on collisions. <REPHRASE> In the UK, a "shared-use footway" or "multi-use path" is for use by both cyclists and pedestrians. <DELETE> Bike paths that follow independent rights-of-way are often used to promote recreational cycling. <DELETE> In Northern European countries, cycling tourism represents a significant proportion of overall tourist activity. <SPLIT> Extensive interurban bike path networks can be found in countries such as Denmark or the Netherlands, which has had a national system of cycle routes since 1993. <DELETE> These networks may use routes dedicated exclusively to cycle traffic or minor rural roads whose use is otherwise restricted to local motor traffic and agricultural machinery. <SPLIT> The "Fietspad" or Bicycle Path in the Netherlands is logically constructed to link shops, housing, stations, schools, workplaces for everyday cycling. <REPHRASE> The more sensible approach is based on efforts to increase Utility cycling. <SPLIT> In countries like Denmark, the Netherlands and Germany the high levels of utility cycling also includes shopping trips e.g. 9% of all shopping trips in Germany are by bicycle.

<DELETE> The Jewish Territorial Organisation, known as the ITO, was a Jewish political movement which first arose in 1903 in response to the British Uganda Offer, but which was institutionalized in 1905. <REPHRASE> Its main goal was to find an alternative territory to that of the Land of Israel, which was preferred by the Zionist movement, for the creation of a Jewish homeland. <DELETE> The organization embraced what became known as "Jewish Territorialism" also known as "Jewish Statism" (though not to be confused with the political philosophy of the same name). <REPHRASE> The ITO was dissolved in 1925. <SPLIT> The Jewish Colonization Association, created in 1891 by the Baron Maurice de Hirsch, was aimed at facilitating mass emigration of Jews from the Russian Empire and other Eastern European countries, by settling them in agricultural colonies on lands purchased by the committee, particularly in North and South America (especially Argentina). <REPHRASE> Before 1905 some Zionist leaders took seriously proposals for Jewish homelands in places other than the Land of Israel. <REPHRASE> Theodor Herzl hoped for a Jewish homeland in the Land of Israel but recognized that global events demanded an immediate solution to the Jewish problem, in Russia at least, even if that solution required Jewish refugees to settle outside of Eretz Israel. <REPHRASE> Theodor Herzl's "Der Judenstaat" argued for a Jewish state in either Palestine, "our ever-memorable historic home", or Argentina, "one of the most fertile countries in the world". <DELETE> Many of the socialist Zionist groups were more territorialist than Zionist, such as Nachman Syrkin's Zionist Socialist Workers Party (the Z.S.). <DELETE> In 1903 British cabinet ministers suggested the British Uganda Program, land for a Jewish state in "Uganda" (actually in modern Kenya). <DELETE> Herzl initially rejected the idea, preferring Palestine, but after the April 1903 Kishinev pogrom Herzl introduced a controversial proposal to the Sixth Zionist Congress to investigate the offer as a temporary measure for Russian Jews in danger. <DELETE> Notwithstanding its emergency and temporary nature, the proposal still proved very divisive, and widespread opposition to the plan was demonstrated by a walkout led by the Russian Jewish delegation to the Congress. <REPHRASE> Few historians believe that such a settlement scheme could have attracted immigrants, Jewish financial support, or international political support. <DELETE> Since there was strong support on the part of some members of the Zionist leadership, however, peace was kept in the movement by the time-honored parliamentary maneuver of voting to establish a committee for the investigation of the possibility, which was not finally dismissed until the 7th Zionist Congress in 1905. <REPHRASE> The Jewish Territorial Organization (ITO) was founded by British Jewish author, critic, and activist Israel Zangwill and British Jewish journalist Lucien Wolf in 1903 and institutionalized in 1905. <DELETE> The establishment was a response to Herzl's rejection of Uganda proposal, as the ITO led by Zangwill split off from the Zionist movement. <DELETE> It attempted to locate territory suitable for Jewish settlement in various parts of America (e.g. Galveston), and on the African, Asian, and Australian continents, yet with little success. <DELETE> In 1905 the members of the Seventh Zionist Congress formally rejected the Uganda Scheme. <DELETE> Following the rejection of the East Africa offer, Zangwill contacted Lucien Wolf, an English Jewish journalist and member of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, the main representative body of Anglo Jewry. <SPLIT> Wolf was an opponent of political Zionism, but did support the creation of Jewish colonies in the Diaspora. <DELETE> In August 1905 Zangwill and Wolf met to discuss the Uganda Scheme, and in subsequent correspondence between the two we learn that both supported the creation of a Jewish colony in British East Africa. <DELETE> Wolf had objected to any specifically "Jewish national homeland", that is to say a state which ghettoized Jews, preserving Jewish customs and law as the basis for governance. <REPHRASE> Though Zangwill's literary works suggest his nostalgia for the ghetto, he too recognized the need for a modern Jewish polity. <DELETE> Both concurred that a self-governing Jewish territory should be based on a preponderance of Jews in the region rather than British legislative fiat, and both concurred that the new government should be formed on a modern, democratic basis rather than some earlier biblical ideal or Eastern European Kehilla structure. <DELETE> This basic agreement between Zangwill and Wolf would lead to the formation of the Jewish Territorial Organisation (ITO), an organisation dedicated to "obtaining a large tract of territory (preferably within the British Empire) wherein to found a Jewish Home of Refuge", and to the elevation of Zangwill to the ITO presidency. <DELETE> After the October Revolution there was in the USSR a Territorialist effort in Ukraine, the Crimea and then in a region surrounding Birobidzhan, where a Jewish Autonomous Region was established in 1934. <REPHRASE> (The Jewish Autonomous Oblast (JAO) ( , "Yevreyskaya avtonomnaya oblast"; ) is still today an autonomous oblast situated in Russia's far east.) <REPHRASE> In the United States, the Organization for Jewish Colonization in Russia worked to encourage the emigration and settlement of Jews there. <SPLIT> In the face of the looming Nazi genocide, Isaac Nachman Steinberg established the Freeland League for Jewish Territorial Colonization in the United States in 1935. <SPLIT> This organization attempted, unsuccessfully, to pursue Jewish autonomy by obtaining a large piece of territory in sparsely populated areas in Ecuador, Australia, or Surinam. <SPLIT> One of the more well-known ventures was the Kimberley Plan, to secure land in Australia. <REPHRASE> The Kimberley Plan was officially vetoed on 15 July 1944 by Australian Prime Minister, John Curtin, who informed Steinberg that the Australian government would not "depart from the long-established policy in regard to alien settlement in Australia" and could not "entertain the proposal for a group settlement of the exclusive type contemplated by the Freeland League". <SPLIT> After the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, Steinberg criticized the exclusivist politics of the Israeli government and continued his attempts to create a non-nationalist Jewish settlement in some other region of the world. <DELETE> After Steinberg's death in 1957 the Freeland League was led by Mordkhe Schaechter, who gradually changed the focus of the organization to more cultural, Yiddishist goals.

<DELETE> An undulator is an insertion device from high-energy physics and usually part of a larger installation, a synchrotron storage ring, or it may be a component of a free electron laser. <REPHRASE> It consists of a periodic structure of dipole magnets. <COPY> These can be permanent magnets or superconducting magnets. <REPHRASE> The static magnetic field alternates along the length of the undulator with a wavelength formula_1. <SPLIT> Electrons traversing the periodic magnet structure are forced to undergo oscillations and thus to radiate energy. <SPLIT> The radiation produced in an undulator is very intense and concentrated in narrow energy bands in the spectrum. <DELETE> It is also collimated on the orbit plane of the electrons. <REPHRASE> This radiation is guided through beamlines for experiments in various scientific areas. <SPLIT> where "e" is the electron charge, "B" is the magnetic field, "formula_1" is the spatial period of the undulator magnets, "formula_4" is the electron rest mass, and "c" is the speed of light. <DELETE> This parameter characterizes the nature of the electron motion. <DELETE> For formula_5 the oscillation amplitude of the motion is small and the radiation displays interference patterns which lead to narrow energy bands. <REPHRASE> If formula_6 the oscillation amplitude is bigger and the radiation contributions from each field period sum up independently, leading to a broad energy spectrum. <SPLIT> In this regime of fields the device is no longer called an "undulator"; it is called a wiggler. <DELETE> The usual description of the undulator is relativistic but classical. <SPLIT> This means that although a precise calculation is tedious, the undulator can be seen as a black box, where only functions inside the device affect how an input is converted to an output; an electron enters the box and an electromagnetic pulse exits through a small exit slit. <DELETE> The slit should be small enough such that only the main cone passes, and the side lobes of the wavelength spectra can be ignored. <DELETE> Undulators can provide several orders of magnitude higher flux than a simple bending magnet and as such are in high demand at synchrotron radiation facilities. <REPHRASE> For an undulator with N periods, the brightness can be up to formula_7 more than a bending magnet. <DELETE> The first factor of N occurs because the intensity is enhanced up to a factor of N at harmonic wavelengths due to the constructive interference of the fields emitted during the N radiation periods. <DELETE> The usual pulse is a sine with some envelope. <REPHRASE> The second factor of N comes from the reduction of the emission angle associated with these harmonics, which is reduced as 1/N. <REPHRASE> When the electrons come with half the period, they interfere destructively, the undulator stays dark. <COPY> The same is true, if they come as a bead chain. <DELETE> The polarization of the emitted radiation can be controlled by using permanent magnets to induce different periodic electron trajectories through the undulator. <REPHRASE> If the oscillations are confined to a plane the radiation will be linearly polarized. <DELETE> If the oscillation trajectory is helical, the radiation will be circularly polarized, with the handedness determined by the helix. <REPHRASE> If the electrons follow the Poisson distribution a partial interference leads to a linear increase in intensity. <DELETE> In the free electron laser the intensity increases exponentially with the number of electrons. <DELETE> An undulator's figure of merit is spectral radiance. <SPLIT> The Russian physicist Vitaly Ginzburg showed theoretically that undulators could be built in a 1947 paper. <DELETE> Julian Schwinger published a useful paper in 1949 that reduced the necessary calculations to Bessel functions, for which there were tables. <SPLIT> This was significant for solving the design equations as digital computers were not available to most academics at that time. <COPY> Hans Motz and his coworkers at Stanford University demonstrated the first undulator in 1952. <REPHRASE> It produced the first manmade coherent infrared radiation. <REPHRASE> The design could produce a total frequency range from visible light down to millimeter waves.

<DELETE> In logic, quantification specifies the quantity of specimens in the domain of discourse that satisfy an open formula. <DELETE> The two most common quantifiers mean "for all" and "there exists". <SPLIT> For example, in arithmetic, quantifiers allow one to say that the natural numbers go on forever, by writing that "for all" n (where n is a natural number), there is another number (say, the successor of n) which is one bigger than n. <DELETE> Two fundamental kinds of quantification in predicate logic are universal quantification and existential quantification. <DELETE> The traditional symbol for the universal quantifier "all" is "∀", a rotated letter "A", and for the existential quantifier "exists" is "∃", a rotated letter "E". <REPHRASE> These quantifiers have been generalized beginning with the work of Mostowski and Lindström. <DELETE> Quantification is used as well in natural languages; examples of quantifiers in English are "for all", "for some", "many", "few", "a lot", and "no;" see Quantifier (linguistics) for details. <REPHRASE> Consider the following statement: This has the appearance of an "infinite conjunction" of propositions. <DELETE> From the point of view of formal languages this is immediately a problem, since syntax rules are expected to generate finite words. <DELETE> The two most common quantifiers are the universal quantifier and the existential quantifier. <SPLIT> The traditional symbol for the universal quantifier is "∀", a rotated letter "A", which stands for "for all" or "all". <SPLIT> The corresponding symbol for the existential quantifier is "∃", a rotated letter "E", which stands for "there exists" or "exists". <DELETE> An example of translating a quantified statement in a natural language such as English would be as follows. <DELETE> Given the statement, "Each of Peter's friends either likes to dance or likes to go to the beach," key aspects can be identified and rewritten using symbols including quantifiers. <SPLIT> So, let "X" be the set of all Peter's friends, "P"("x") the predicate ""x" likes to dance", and "Q"("x") the predicate ""x" likes to go to the beach". <DELETE> Then the above sentence can be written in formal notation as formula_1, which is read, "for every "x" that is a member of "X", "P" applies to "x" or "Q" applies to "x"." <REPHRASE> The order of quantifiers is critical to meaning, as is illustrated by the following two propositions: This is clearly true; it just asserts that every natural number has a square. <SPLIT> The meaning of the assertion in which the order of quantifiers is inversed is different: This is clearly false; it asserts that there is a single natural number "s" that is at the same time the square of "every" natural number. <DELETE> This is because the syntax directs that any variable cannot be a function of subsequently introduced variables. <DELETE> A few other quantifiers have been proposed over time. <REPHRASE> In particular, the solution quantifier, noted § (section sign) and read "those". <COPY> For example, is read "those "n" in N such that "n" ≤ 4 are in {0,1,2}." <DELETE> The same construct is expressible in set-builder notation as <REPHRASE> Term logic, also called Aristotelian logic, treats quantification in a manner that is closer to natural language, and also less suited to formal analysis. <DELETE> Term logic treated "All", "Some" and "No" in the 4th century BC, in an account also touching on the alethic modalities. <DELETE> Gottlob Frege, in his 1879 "Begriffsschrift", was the first to employ a quantifier to bind a variable ranging over a domain of discourse and appearing in predicates. <DELETE> He would universally quantify a variable (or relation) by writing the variable over a dimple in an otherwise straight line appearing in his diagrammatic formulas. <DELETE> Frege did not devise an explicit notation for existential quantification, instead employing his equivalent of ~∀"x"~, or contraposition. <DELETE> Frege's treatment of quantification went largely unremarked until Bertrand Russell's 1903 "Principles of Mathematics". <SPLIT> In work that culminated in Peirce (1885), Charles Sanders Peirce and his student Oscar Howard Mitchell independently invented universal and existential quantifiers, and bound variables. <COPY> Peirce and Mitchell wrote Π and Σ where we now write ∀"x" and ∃"x". <SPLIT> Peirce's notation can be found in the writings of Ernst Schröder, Leopold Loewenheim, Thoralf Skolem, and Polish logicians into the 1950s. <REPHRASE> Most notably, it is the notation of Kurt Gödel's landmark 1930 paper on the completeness of first-order logic, and 1931 paper on the incompleteness of Peano arithmetic. <SPLIT> Peirce's approach to quantification also influenced William Ernest Johnson and Giuseppe Peano, who invented yet another notation, namely ("x") for the universal quantification of "x" and (in 1897) ∃"x" for the existential quantification of "x". <SPLIT> Hence for decades, the canonical notation in philosophy and mathematical logic was ("x")"P" to express "all individuals in the domain of discourse have the property "P"," and "(∃"x")"P"" for "there exists at least one individual in the domain of discourse having the property "P"." <REPHRASE> Peano, who was much better known than Peirce, in effect diffused the latter's thinking throughout Europe. <REPHRASE> Peano's notation was adopted by the "Principia Mathematica" of Whitehead and Russell, Quine, and Alonzo Church. <DELETE> In 1935, Gentzen introduced the ∀ symbol, by analogy with Peano's ∃ symbol. <REPHRASE> ∀ did not become canonical until the 1960s.
<SPLIT> Alfred Rupert Sheldrake (born 28 June 1942) is an English author, and researcher in the field of parapsychology, who proposed the concept of morphic resonance, a conjecture which lacks mainstream acceptance and has been characterised as pseudoscience. <REPHRASE> He worked as a biochemist at Cambridge University from 1967 to 1973 and as principal plant physiologist at the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics in India until 1978. <SPLIT> Sheldrake reported "being drawn back to a Christian path" during his time in India, and self-identifies as Anglican. <REPHRASE> Sheldrake is married to therapist, voice teacher and author Jill Purce. <COPY> They have two sons, the biologist Merlin Sheldrake and the musician Cosmo Sheldrake. <DELETE> Reviews of Sheldrake's books have at times been extremely negative over their scientific content, but some have been positive. <SPLIT> In 2009, Adam Rutherford, geneticist and deputy editor of "Nature", criticised Sheldrake's books for containing research that was not subjected to the peer-review process expected for science, and suggested that his books were best "ignored." <DELETE> In September 1981, "Nature" published an editorial about "A New Science of Life" entitled "A book for burning?" <DELETE> In January 2013, Sheldrake gave a TEDx lecture at TEDxWhitechapel in East London roughly summarising ideas from his book, "The Science Delusion". <DELETE> In his talk, Sheldrake stated that modern science rests on ten dogmas which "fall apart" upon examination and promoted his hypothesis of morphic resonance.
<REPHRASE> Halophiles are organisms that thrive in high salt concentrations. <REPHRASE> They are a type of extremophile organism. <COPY> The name comes from the Greek word for "salt-loving". <DELETE> While most halophiles are classified into the Archaea domain, there are also bacterial halophiles and some eukaryota, such as the alga "Dunaliella salina" or fungus "Wallemia ichthyophaga". <REPHRASE> Some well-known species give off a red color from carotenoid compounds, notably bacteriorhodopsin. <DELETE> Halophiles can be found anywhere with a concentration of salt five times greater than the salt concentration of the ocean, such as the Great Salt Lake in Utah, Owens Lake in California, the Dead Sea, and in evaporation ponds. <DELETE> Halophiles are categorized as slight, moderate, or extreme, by the extent of their halotolerance. <DELETE> Slight halophiles prefer 0.3 to 0.8 M (1.7 to 4.8%—seawater is 0.6 M or 3.5%), moderate halophiles 0.8 to 3.4 M (4.7 to 20%), and extreme halophiles 3.4 to 5.1 M (20 to 30%) salt content. <DELETE> Halophiles require sodium chloride (salt) for growth, in contrast to halotolerant organisms, which do not require salt but can grow under saline conditions. <REPHRASE> High salinity represents an extreme environment to which relatively few organisms have been able to adapt and occupy. <DELETE> Most halophilic and all halotolerant organisms expend energy to exclude salt from their cytoplasm to avoid protein aggregation ('salting out'). <DELETE> To survive the high salinities, halophiles employ two differing strategies to prevent desiccation through osmotic movement of water out of their cytoplasm. <DELETE> Both strategies work by increasing the internal osmolarity of the cell. <DELETE> In the first (which is employed by the majority of halophilic bacteria, some archaea, yeasts, algae and fungi), organic compounds are accumulated in the cytoplasm—osmoprotectants which are known as compatible solutes. <DELETE> These can be either synthesised or accumulated from the environment. <DELETE> The most common compatible solutes are neutral or zwitterionic, and include amino acids, sugars, polyols, betaines, and ectoines, as well as derivatives of some of these compounds. <DELETE> The second, more radical adaptation involves the selective influx of potassium (K) ions into the cytoplasm. <REPHRASE> This adaptation is restricted to the moderately halophilic bacterial order Halanaerobiales, the extremely halophilic archaeal family Halobacteriaceae, and the extremely halophilic bacterium "Salinibacter ruber". <REPHRASE> The presence of this adaptation in three distinct evolutionary lineages suggests convergent evolution of this strategy, it being unlikely to be an ancient characteristic retained in only scattered groups or passed on through massive lateral gene transfer. <REPHRASE> The primary reason for this is the entire intracellular machinery (enzymes, structural proteins, etc.) must be adapted to high salt levels, whereas in the compatible solute adaptation, little or no adjustment is required to intracellular macromolecules; in fact, the compatible solutes often act as more general stress protectants, as well as just osmoprotectants.

<REPHRASE> The Peak District is an upland area in England at the southern end of the Pennines. <REPHRASE> It is mostly in northern Derbyshire, but also includes parts of Cheshire, Greater Manchester, Staffordshire, West Yorkshire and South Yorkshire. <SPLIT> An area of great diversity, it is mostly split into the Dark Peak, where most of the moorland is found and the geology is gritstone, and the limestone area of the White Peak. <REPHRASE> The Peak District National Park became the first national park in the United Kingdom in 1951. <SPLIT> With its proximity to the cities of Manchester, Stoke-on-Trent, Derby and Sheffield, and access by road and rail, it attracts millions of visitors every year. <DELETE> The Peak District is at the southern end of the Pennines and much of the area is upland above 1000 ft . <REPHRASE> Its high point is Kinder Scout at 2087 ft . <REPHRASE> Despite its name, the landscape generally lacks sharp peaks, and is characterised mostly by rounded hills, plateaus, valleys, limestone gorges and gritstone escarpments (the "edges"). <SPLIT> The area, mostly rural, is surrounded by conurbations and large urban areas including Manchester, Huddersfield, Sheffield, Derby and Stoke-on-Trent. <REPHRASE> The Peak is formed almost exclusively from sedimentary rocks dating from the Carboniferous period. <SPLIT> They comprise the Carboniferous Limestone, overlying Gritstone and the Coal Measures which occur only on the extreme margins and infrequent outcrops of igneous rocks including lavas, tuffs and volcanic vent agglomerates. <REPHRASE> The general geological structure is that of a broad dome, whose western margins have been most intensely faulted and folded. <SPLIT> Uplift and erosion have effectively sliced the top off the dome to reveal a concentric outcrop pattern with Coal Measures rocks on the eastern and western margins, Carboniferous Limestone at the core and with rocks of Millstone Grit outcropping between them. <REPHRASE> The southern edge of the dome is overlain by sandstones of Triassic age though they barely impinge on the National Park. <REPHRASE> The White Peak is the central and southern section where Carboniferous Limestone is found at or near the surface. <REPHRASE> The Dark Peak to the north, east and west is characterised by Millstone Grit outcrops and broad swathes of moorland. <REPHRASE> Earth movements after the Carboniferous period resulted in the up-doming of the area and, particularly in the west, the folding of the rock strata along north–south axes. <SPLIT> The region was raised in a north–south line which resulted in the dome-like shape and the shales and sandstones were worn away until limestone was exposed. <SPLIT> At the end of this period, the Earth's crust sank here which led to the area being covered by sea, depositing a variety of new rocks. <REPHRASE> Some time after its deposition, mineral veins were formed in the limestone. <REPHRASE> The veins and rakes have been mined for lead since Roman times. <SPLIT> The Peak District was covered by ice during at least one of the ice ages of the last 2 million years (probably the Anglian glaciation of around 450,000 years ago) as evidenced by the patches of glacial till or boulder clay that can be found across the area. <DELETE> It was not covered by ice during the last glacial period, which peaked around 20,000–22,000 years ago. <DELETE> A mix of Irish Sea and Lake District ice abutted against its western margins. <REPHRASE> Glacial meltwaters eroded a complex of sinuous channels along this margin of the district during this period. <REPHRASE> Glacial meltwaters contributed to the formation and development of many caves in the limestone area. <SPLIT> Wild animal herds roamed the area, and their remains have been found in several of the local caves. <REPHRASE> The different types of rock beneath the soil strongly influence the landscape; they determine the type of vegetation that will grow, and ultimately the type of animal that will inhabit the area. <SPLIT> Limestone has fissures and is soluble in water, therefore rivers have been able to carve deep, narrow valleys. <REPHRASE> The rivers then often find routes underground, creating cave systems. <SPLIT> Millstone Grit is insoluble but porous, absorbing water which seeps through the grits, until it meets the less porous shales beneath, creating springs where it reaches the surface. <SPLIT> The shales are friable and easily attacked by frost and form areas that are vulnerable to landslides, as on Mam Tor.

<SPLIT> The Statute of Westminster 1931 is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom whose modified versions are now domestic law within Australia and Canada; it has been repealed in New Zealand and implicitly in former Dominions that are no longer Commonwealth realms. <DELETE> Passed on 11 December 1931, the act, either immediately or upon ratification, effectively both established the legislative independence of the self-governing Dominions of the British Empire from the United Kingdom and bound them all to seek each other's approval for changes to monarchical titles and the common line of succession. <SPLIT> It thus became a statutory embodiment of the principles of equality and common allegiance to the Crown set out in the Balfour Declaration of 1926. <REPHRASE> As the statute removed nearly all of the British parliament's authority to legislate for the Dominions, it had the effect of making the Dominions largely sovereign nations in their own right. <REPHRASE> It was a crucial step in the development of the Dominions as separate states. <DELETE> The Statute of Westminster's relevance today is that it sets the basis for the continuing relationship between the Commonwealth realms and the Crown.

<REPHRASE> Professor (commonly abbreviated as Prof.) is an academic rank at universities and other post-secondary education and research institutions in most countries. <SPLIT> Literally, "professor" derives from Latin as a "person who professes" being usually an expert in arts or sciences, a teacher of the highest rank. <SPLIT> In most systems of academic ranks the word "professor" only refers to the most senior academic position, sometimes informally known as "full professor". <SPLIT> In some countries or institutions, the word "professor" is also used in titles of lower ranks such as associate professor and assistant professor;

ranking above senior lecturer and below full professor. <DELETE> Beyond holding the proper academic title, universities in many countries also give notable artists, athletes and foreign dignitaries the title "honorary professor", even if these persons do not have the academic qualifications typically necessary for professorship and they do not take up professorial duties. <REPHRASE> However, such "professors" usually do not undertake academic work for the granting institution. <DELETE> In general, the title of professor is strictly used for academic positions rather than for those holding it on honorary basis. <REPHRASE> A professor typically earns a base salary and a range of benefits. <REPHRASE> In addition, a professor who undertakes additional roles in their institution (e.g., department chair, dean, head of graduate studies, etc.) earns additional income. <SPLIT> Some professors also earn additional income by moonlighting in other jobs, such as consulting, publishing academic or popular press books, giving speeches, or coaching executives. <REPHRASE> Some fields (e.g., business and computer science) give professors more opportunities for outside work. <REPHRASE> The table below shows the final reference wages (per month or year?) <DELETE> expressed in net amounts of Dutch Euros in 2014. <REPHRASE> (i.e., converted into Dutch purchasing power). <SPLIT> In a number of countries, the title "research professor" refers to a professor who is exclusively or mainly engaged in research, and who has few or no teaching obligations. <DELETE> For example, the title is used in this sense in the United Kingdom (where it is known as research professor at some universities and professorial research fellow at some other institutions) and in northern Europe. <DELETE> Research professor is usually the most senior rank of a research-focused career pathway in those countries, and regarded as equal to the ordinary full professor rank. <DELETE> Most often they are permanent employees, and the position is often held by particularly distinguished scholars;

<SPLIT> Friedrich August Kekulé, later Friedrich August Kekule von Stradonitz ( ; ] ; 7 September 1829 – 13 July 1896), was a German organic chemist. <REPHRASE> From the 1850s until his death, Kekulé was one of the most prominent chemists in Europe, especially in theoretical chemistry. <REPHRASE> He was the principal founder of the theory of chemical structure. <REPHRASE> The son of a civil servant, Kekulé was born in Darmstadt, the capital of the Grand Duchy of Hesse. <REPHRASE> After graduating from secondary school (the Grand Ducal Gymnasium in Darmstadt), in the fall of 1847 he entered the University of Giessen, with the intention of studying architecture. <REPHRASE> After hearing the lectures of Justus von Liebig in his first semester, he decided to study chemistry. <SPLIT> Following four years of study in Giessen and a brief compulsory military service, he took temporary assistantships in Paris (1851–52), in Chur, Switzerland (1852–53), and in London (1853–55), where he was decisively influenced by Alexander Williamson. <REPHRASE> His Giessen doctoral degree was awarded in the summer of 1852. <REPHRASE> In 1856 Kekulé became Privatdozent at the University of Heidelberg. <SPLIT> In 1858 he was hired as full professor at the University of Ghent, then in 1867 he was called to Bonn, where he remained for the rest of his career. <DELETE> Basing his ideas on those of predecessors such as Williamson, Edward Frankland, William Odling, Auguste Laurent, Charles-Adolphe Wurtz and others, Kekulé was the principal formulator of the theory of chemical structure (1857–58). <REPHRASE> This theory proceeds from the idea of atomic valence, especially the tetravalence of carbon (which Kekulé announced late in 1857) and the ability of carbon atoms to link to each other (announced in a paper published in May 1858), to the determination of the bonding order of all of the atoms in a molecule. <SPLIT> Archibald Scott Couper independently arrived at the idea of self-linking of carbon atoms (his paper appeared in June 1858), and provided the first molecular formulas where lines symbolize bonds connecting the atoms. <DELETE> For organic chemists, the theory of structure provided dramatic new clarity of understanding, and a reliable guide to both analytic and especially synthetic work. <REPHRASE> As a consequence, the field of organic chemistry developed explosively from this point. <REPHRASE> Among those who were most active in pursuing early structural investigations were, in addition to Kekulé and Couper, Frankland, Wurtz, Alexander Crum Brown, Emil Erlenmeyer, and Alexander Butlerov. <REPHRASE> Kekulé's most famous work was on the structure of benzene. <SPLIT> In 1865 Kekulé published a paper in French (for he was then still in Belgium) suggesting that the structure contained a six-membered ring of carbon atoms with alternating single and double bonds. <COPY> The following year he published a much longer paper in German on the same subject. <SPLIT> The empirical formula for benzene had been long known, but its highly unsaturated structure was a challenge to determine. <SPLIT> Archibald Scott Couper in 1858 and Joseph Loschmidt in 1861 suggested possible structures that contained multiple double bonds or multiple rings, but the study of aromatic compounds was in its earliest years, and too little evidence was then available to help chemists decide on any particular structure.

<SPLIT> Reply 1997 is a 2012 South Korean television series that centers on the lives of six friends in Busan, as the timeline moves back and forth between their past as 18-year-old high schoolers in 1997 and their present as 33-year-olds at their high school reunion dinner in 2012, where one couple will announce that they're getting married. <DELETE> As the first installment of the "Reply" series, it also portrays the extreme fan culture that emerged in the 1990s when first generation idol groups such as H.O.T. and Sechs Kies took center stage and K-pop was just beginning to blossom. <SPLIT> The series originally aired live on cable channel tvN in 16 episodes (14 30-minute episodes aired back-to-back over a period of 7 weeks, with the last 2 episodes aired separately and lasting 1 hour each due to the amount of material the staff didn't want to edit out). <REPHRASE> However, due to its popularity, the 15th and 16th episodes were also aired simultaneously on Mnet, OCN, O'live, Ongamenet and OnStyle. <REPHRASE> Another series from the same writer and director, "Reply 1994" was produced in 2013. <SPLIT> Set in a college campus, it follows the pop culture events of that year, including the emergence of seminal K-pop group Seo Taiji and Boys and the basketball craze of the era.
<REPHRASE> Derealization (sometimes abbreviated as DR) is an alteration in the perception or experience of the external world so that it seems unreal. <SPLIT> Other symptoms include feeling as though one's environment is lacking in spontaneity, emotional coloring, and depth. <DELETE> It is a dissociative symptom of many conditions. <DELETE> Derealization is a subjective experience of unreality of the outside world, while depersonalization is sense of unreality in one's personal self, although most authors currently do not regard derealization (surroundings) and depersonalization (self) as separate constructs.
<REPHRASE> Suman Sahai is an Indian activist and the founder of Gene Campaign. <REPHRASE> Sahai obtained a Ph.D. from the Indian Agricultural Research Institute in 1975. <DELETE> She then successively worked at the University of Alberta, University of Chicago, and the University of Heidelberg, where she obtained her habilitation in human genetics. <SPLIT> According to the Web of Science, Sahai has published over 40 articles, mostly on policy issues relating to genetically modified organisms, which have been cited over 150 times, giving her an h-index of 7. <COPY> She is director of the NGO, Gene Campaign. <DELETE> In April 2013, Sahai was shown to have committed plagiarism in her habilitation thesis, which had been submitted to the University of Heidelberg in 1986. <SPLIT> In addition, she was accused of presenting herself as being or having been a professor at that University, without ever actually having occupied such a position. <REPHRASE> On 14 April 2013, the University of Heidelberg confirmed that plagiarism had taken place, that Sahai has no right to call herself a professor of the University of Heidelberg, and that in consequence Sahai had agreed to renounce her "venia legendi".

<DELETE> The Gallic group is a dynamical grouping of the prograde irregular satellites of Saturn following similar orbits. <REPHRASE> Their semi-major axes range between 16 and 19 Gm, their inclinations between 35° and 40°, and their eccentricities around 0.53. <REPHRASE> The International Astronomical Union (IAU) reserves names taken from Gallic mythology for these moons. <REPHRASE> Similar mean orbital elements led the discoverers to postulate a common origin for the group in a breakup of a larger body. <REPHRASE> The group was later found to be physically homogeneous, all satellites displaying "light-red" colour (colour indices B − V = 0.91 and V − R = 0.48) and similar infrared indices <SPLIT> Remarkably, recent observations revealed that the largest member of the group, Albiorix, displays actually two different colours: one compatible with Erriapus and Tarvos, and another less red. <SPLIT> Instead of the common progenitor, it was postulated that Tarvos and Erriapus could be fragments of Albiorix, leaving a large, less red crater. <DELETE> Such an impact would require a body with the diameter in excess of 1 km and relative velocity close to 5 km/s, resulting in a large crater with the radius of 12 km. <REPHRASE> Numerous, very large craters observed on Phoebe, prove the existence of such collisions in the Saturnian system's past.
<DELETE> The International Opium Convention, signed at The Hague on January 23, 1912 during the First International Opium Conference, was the first international drug control treaty. <REPHRASE> It was registered in "League of Nations Treaty Series" on January 23, 1922. <DELETE> The United States convened a 13-nation conference of the International Opium Commission in 1909 in Shanghai, China in response to increasing criticism of the opium trade. <COPY> The treaty was signed by Germany, the United States, China, France, the United Kingdom, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Persia, Portugal, Russia, and Siam. <SPLIT> The Convention provided, "The contracting Powers shall use their best endeavours to control, or to cause to be controlled, all persons manufacturing, importing, selling, distributing, and exporting morphine, cocaine, and their respective salts, as well as the buildings in which these persons carry such an industry or trade." <DELETE> The Convention was implemented in 1915 by the United States, Netherlands, China, Honduras, and Norway. <DELETE> It went into force globally in 1919, when it was incorporated into the Treaty of Versailles. <DELETE> The primary objective of the convention was to introduce restrictions on exports as opposed to imposing prohibition or criminalising the use and cultivation of opium, coca, and cannabis. <DELETE> That explains the withdrawal of the United States and China, which were gravitating towards prohibitionist approaches, as well as the beginning of negotiations leading to the 1925 International Opium Convention in Geneva. <REPHRASE> A revised International Opium Convention "International Convention relating to Dangerous Drugs" was signed at Geneva on February 19, 1925, which went into effect on September 25, 1938, and was registered in "League of Nations Treaty Series" on the same day. <DELETE> It introduced a statistical control system to be supervised by a Permanent Central Opium Board, a body of the League of Nations. <SPLIT> Egypt, with support from China and United States, recommended that a prohibition on hashish be added to the Convention, and a sub-committee proposed the following text: The use of Indian hemp and the preparations derived therefrom may only be authorized for medical and scientific purposes. <DELETE> The raw resin (charas), however, which is extracted from the female tops of the cannabis sativa L, together with the various preparations (hashish, chira, esrar, diamba, etc.) of which it forms the basis, not being at present utilized for medical purposes and only being susceptible of utilisation for harmful purposes, in the same manner as other narcotics, may not be produced, sold, traded in, etc., under any circumstances whatsoever. <SPLIT> India and other countries objected to this language, citing social and religious customs and the prevalence of wild-growing cannabis plants that would make it difficult to enforce. <REPHRASE> Accordingly, this provision never made it into the final treaty. <SPLIT> A compromise was made that banned exportation of "Indian hemp" to countries that have prohibited its use, and requiring importing countries to issue certificates approving the importation and stating that the shipment was required "exclusively for medical or scientific purposes." <DELETE> It also required Parties to "exercise an effective control of such a nature as to prevent the illicit international traffic in Indian hemp and especially in the resin." <DELETE> These restrictions still left considerable leeway for countries to allow production, internal trade, and use of cannabis for recreational purposes. <DELETE> The Convention was superseded by the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs.
<REPHRASE> An ecosystem is a community of living organisms in conjunction with the nonliving components of their environment, interacting as a system. <REPHRASE> These biotic and abiotic components are linked together through nutrient cycles and energy flows. <REPHRASE> Energy enters the system through photosynthesis and is incorporated into plant tissue. <REPHRASE> By feeding on plants and on one-another, animals play an important role in the movement of matter and energy through the system. <REPHRASE> They also influence the quantity of plant and microbial biomass present. <SPLIT> By breaking down dead organic matter, decomposers release carbon back to the atmosphere and facilitate nutrient cycling by converting nutrients stored in dead biomass back to a form that can be readily used by plants and other microbes. <DELETE> Primary production is the production of organic matter from inorganic carbon sources. <COPY> This mainly occurs through photosynthesis. <REPHRASE> The energy incorporated through this process supports life on earth, while the carbon makes up much of the organic matter in living and dead biomass, soil carbon and fossil fuels. <DELETE> It also drives the carbon cycle, which influences global climate via the greenhouse effect. <SPLIT> Through the process of photosynthesis, plants capture energy from light and use it to combine carbon dioxide and water to produce carbohydrates and oxygen. <SPLIT> The photosynthesis carried out by all the plants in an ecosystem is called the gross primary production (GPP). <REPHRASE> About half of the GPP is consumed in plant respiration. <REPHRASE> The remainder, that portion of GPP that is not used up by respiration, is known as the net primary production (NPP). <REPHRASE> Total photosynthesis is limited by a range of environmental factors. <REPHRASE> These include the amount of light available, the amount of leaf area a plant has to capture light (shading by other plants is a major limitation of photosynthesis), rate at which carbon dioxide can be supplied to the chloroplasts to support photosynthesis, the availability of water, and the availability of suitable temperatures for carrying out photosynthesis. <DELETE> Ecosystems are dynamic entities. <REPHRASE> They are subject to periodic disturbances and are in the process of recovering from some past disturbance.

<SPLIT> John Forrest Dillon (December 25, 1831 – May 6, 1914) was an attorney in Iowa and New York, a Justice of the Iowa Supreme Court and a United States Circuit Judge of the United States Circuit Courts for the Eighth Circuit. <DELETE> He authored a highly influential treatise on the power of states over municipal governments. <SPLIT> Born on December 25, 1831, in Northampton, (then part of Montgomery County, now part of Fulton County), New York, Dillon received a Doctor of Medicine in 1850 from the University of Iowa. <REPHRASE> He read law in 1852. <REPHRASE> He entered private practice in Davenport, Iowa from 1852 to 1853. <REPHRASE> He was county attorney for Scott County, Iowa from 1853 to 1858. <REPHRASE> He was a Judge of the Iowa District Court for the Seventh Judicial District from 1858 to 1862. <COPY> He was a Justice of the Iowa Supreme Court from 1862 to 1868. <SPLIT> While on the federal bench, Dillon wrote "Municipal Corporations" (1872), one of the earliest systematic studies of the subject. <REPHRASE> He also authored "Removal of Cases from State Courts to Federal Courts" and "Municipal Bonds", both in 1876. <REPHRASE> On February 17, 1876, during the Whiskey Ring graft prosecutions, Justice Dillon ruled Ulysses S. Grant's deposition for Orville E. Babcock was admissible in court. <REPHRASE> Following his resignation from the federal bench, Dillon was a Professor of law for Columbia University from 1879 to 1882. <REPHRASE> He resumed private practice in New York City, New York from 1882 to 1914. <COPY> He was the Storrs Professor of law at Yale University from 1891 to 1892. <REPHRASE> He died on May 6, 1914, in New York City. <SPLIT> A memorial fountain to Dillon was erected in downtown Davenport in 1918, carved of Indiana limestone in Romanesque style, by sculptor Harry Liva. <REPHRASE> In 1853, Dillon married Anna Margery Price (born 19 June 1835). <COPY> They had two sons and a daughter. <REPHRASE> Anna and their daughter, Mrs. Annie Dillon Oliver, died in the sinking of the French ocean liner SS "La Bourgogne" in July, 1898. <REPHRASE> Dillon's oldest son, Hiram Price Dillon (1855–1918), became a lawyer in Iowa and a Master of Chancery in federal court. <DELETE> John F. Dillon's sister married John B. Jordan, a Davenport merchant. <COPY> That marriage produced a daughter Jennie, who married Louis Stengel. <SPLIT> Louis and Jennie Stengel had a son, Charles Dillon (Casey) Stengel, named after the Judge, who had a long career as a baseball player and manager. <SPLIT> The theory of state preeminence over local governments was expressed as Dillon's Rule in an 1868 case: "Municipal corporations owe their origin to, and derive their powers and rights wholly from, the legislature. <COPY> It breathes into them the breath of life, without which they cannot exist. <COPY> As it creates, so may it destroy. <DELETE> If it may destroy, it may abridge and control". <REPHRASE> By contrast, the Cooley Doctrine, or the doctrine of home rule, expressed the theory of an inherent right to local self-determination. <DELETE> In a concurring opinion, Michigan Supreme Court Judge Thomas M. Cooley in 1871 stated, "local government is a matter of absolute right; and the state cannot take it away". <DELETE> In "Municipal Corporations" (1872), Dillon explained that in contrast to the powers of states, which are unlimited but for express restrictions under the state or federal constitution, municipalities only have the powers that are expressly granted to them. <REPHRASE> This formulation of the scope of municipal power came to be known as "Dillon's Rule." <DELETE> It holds that municipal governments have only the powers expressly granted to them by the state legislature, those powers necessarily implied by the express powers, and those that are essential and indispensable to the municipality's existence and functioning. <DELETE> Further, the powers expressly granted to the municipality should be narrowly construed, and any ambiguities in the legislative grant of power should be resolved against the municipality. <DELETE> However, when the state has not specifically directed the method by which the municipality may implement its granted power, the municipality has the discretion to choose the method so long as its choice is reasonable. <DELETE> The Supreme Court of the United States cited "Municipal Corporations" and fully adopted Dillon's emphasis on state power over municipalities in "Hunter v. Pittsburgh", which upheld the power of Pennsylvania to consolidate the city of Allegheny into the city of Pittsburgh, despite the objections of a majority of Allegheny's residents. <DELETE> The Court's ruling that states could alter or abolish at will the charters of municipal corporations without infringing upon contract rights relied upon Dillon's distinction between public, municipal corporations and private ones. <DELETE> However, the Court did not prevent states from passing legislation or amending their constitutions to explicitly allow home rule. <SPLIT> This constitutional allowance was reiterated in "Trenton v. New Jersey", where the Supreme Court held that "In the absence of state constitutional provisions safeguarding it to them, municipalities have no inherent right of self-government which is beyond the legislative control of the state, but are merely departments of the state, with powers and privileges such as the state has seen fit to grant, held and exercised subject to its sovereign will”. <DELETE> Hundreds of United States court decisions have employed the Dillon Rule to determine the scope of municipal powers and rights. <SPLIT> Critics of the rule have argued that it imposes unreasonable constraints on the ability of communities to govern themselves and undermines democracy or that local self-government is a matter of natural right that does not need to be conferred by higher political structures. <DELETE> Some have suggested that Dillon's approach derived from the contemporary view that cities were inherently corrupt political organs. <SPLIT> States which do not follow Dillon's Rule—"home rule" states, including Dillon's own Iowa—remain in the minority, despite the significant decrease in the public perception of municipal corruption.
<SPLIT> Pharaoh's Island is an island in the River Thames, in Surrey, England, 270 m upstream of Shepperton Lock. <REPHRASE> It was purchased by the Treasury to give to Admiral Nelson after the Battle of the Nile (1798). <REPHRASE> He used it as a fishing retreat.

<SPLIT> The Lions Gate Bridge, opened in 1938, officially known as the First Narrows Bridge, is a suspension bridge that crosses the first narrows of Burrard Inlet and connects the City of Vancouver, British Columbia, to the North Shore municipalities of the District of North Vancouver, the City of North Vancouver, and West Vancouver. <REPHRASE> The term "Lions Gate" refers to The Lions, a pair of mountain peaks north of Vancouver.
<DELETE> The Turin King List, also known as the Turin Royal Canon, is an ancient Egyptian hieratic papyrus thought to date from the reign of Pharaoh Ramesses II, now in the Museo Egizio (Egyptian Museum) in Turin. <REPHRASE> The papyrus is the most extensive list available of kings compiled by the ancient Egyptians, and is the basis for most chronology before the reign of Ramesses II. <SPLIT> The papyrus is believed to date from the reign of Ramesses II, during the middle of the New Kingdom, or the 19th Dynasty. <DELETE> The beginning and ending of the list are now lost; there is no introduction, and the list does not continue after the 19th Dynasty. <REPHRASE> The composition may thus have occurred at any subsequent time, from the reign of Ramesses II to as late as the 20th Dynasty. <SPLIT> The papyrus lists the names of rulers, the lengths of reigns in years, with months and days for some kings. <REPHRASE> In some cases they are grouped together by family, which corresponds approximately to the dynasties of Manetho’s book. <DELETE> The list includes the names of ephemeral rulers or those ruling small territories that may be unmentioned in other sources. <REPHRASE> The list also is believed to contain kings from the 15th Dynasty, the Hyksos who ruled Lower Egypt and the River Nile delta. <SPLIT> The Hyksos rulers do not have cartouches (enclosing borders which indicate the name of a king), and a hieroglyphic sign is added to indicate that they were foreigners, although typically on King Lists foreign rulers are not listed. <SPLIT> The papyrus was originally a tax roll, but on its back is written a list of rulers of Egypt – including mythical kings such as gods, demi-gods, and spirits, as well as human kings. <DELETE> That the back of an older papyrus was used may indicate that the list was not of great formal importance to the writer, although the primary function of the list is thought to have been as an administrative aid. <SPLIT> As such, the papyrus is less likely to be biased against certain rulers and is believed to include all the kings of Egypt known to its writers up to the 19th or 20th Dynasty. <SPLIT> The papyrus was found by the Italian traveler Bernardino Drovetti in 1820 at Luxor (Thebes), Egypt and was acquired in 1824 by the Egyptian Museum in Turin, Italy and was designated Papyrus Number 1874. <SPLIT> When the box in which it had been transported to Italy was unpacked, the list had disintegrated into small fragments. <SPLIT> Jean-Francois Champollion, examining it, could recognize only some of the larger fragments containing royal names, and produced a drawing of what he could decipher. <REPHRASE> A reconstruction of the list was created to better understand it and to aid in research. <SPLIT> The Saxon researcher Gustav Seyffarth (1796–1885) re-examined the fragments, some only one square centimeter in size, and made a more complete reconstruction of the papyrus based only on the papyrus fibers, as he could not yet determine the meaning of the hieratic characters. <SPLIT> Subsequent work on the fragments was done by the Munich Egyptologist Jens Peter Lauth, which largely confirmed the Seyffarth reconstruction. <SPLIT> In 1997, prominent Egyptologist Kim Ryholt published a new and better interpretation of the list in his book, "The Political Situation in Egypt during the Second Intermediate Period c. 1800–1550 B.C." After another study of the papyrus, an updated version from Ryholt is expected. <SPLIT> Egyptologist Donald Redford has also studied the papyrus and has noted that although many of the list's names correspond to monuments and other documents, there are some discrepancies and not all of the names correspond, questioning the absolute reliability of the document for pre-Ramesses II chronology. <REPHRASE> Despite attempts at reconstruction, approximately 50% of the papyrus remains missing. <SPLIT> This papyrus as presently constituted is 1.7 m long and 0.41 m wide, broken into over 160 fragments. <REPHRASE> In 2009, previously unpublished fragments were discovered in the storage room of the Egyptian Museum of Turin, in good condition. <REPHRASE> A new edition of the papyrus is expected. <SPLIT> The name Hudjefa, found twice in the papyrus, is now known to have been used by the royal scribes of the Ramesside era during the 19th dynasty of ancient Egypt when the scribes compiled king lists such as the royal table of Sakkara and the royal canon of Turin and the name of a deceased pharaoh was unreadable, damaged, or completely erased. <REPHRASE> The papyrus is divided into eleven columns, distributed as follows. <REPHRASE> The names and positions of several kings are still being disputed, since the list is so badly damaged.

<SPLIT> SABMiller plc was a multinational brewing and beverage company headquartered in Woking, England on the outskirts of London until 10 October 2016 when it was acquired by Anheuser-Busch InBev. <SPLIT> Prior to that date, it was the world's second-largest brewer measured by revenues (after Anheuser-Busch InBev) and was also a major bottler of Coca-Cola. <COPY> Its brands included Fosters, Miller, and Pilsner Urquell. <REPHRASE> It operated in 80 countries worldwide and in 2009 sold around 21 billion litres of beverages. <DELETE> Since 10 October 2016, SABMiller has been a business division of Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV, a Brazilian-Belgian corporation with headquarters in Leuven. <SPLIT> SABMiller was founded as South African Breweries in 1895 to serve a growing market of miners and prospectors in and around Johannesburg. <DELETE> Two years later, it became the first industrial company to list on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. <REPHRASE> From the early 1990s onwards, the company increasingly expanded internationally, making several acquisitions in both emerging and developed markets. <DELETE> In 1999, it formed a new UK-based holding company, SAB plc, and moved its primary listing to London. <REPHRASE> In May 2002, SAB plc acquired Miller Brewing, forming SABMiller plc. <REPHRASE> The origins of the company date back to the foundation of South African Breweries in 1895 in South Africa. <DELETE> For many decades, the operations of South African Breweries were mainly limited to southern Africa, where it had established a dominant position in the market during South African Apartheid, until 1990 when it began investing in Europe. <SPLIT> After acquiring SABMiller, Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV agreed on 21 December 2016 to sell the former SABMiller Ltd. business in Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania to Asahi for US$7.8 billion. <COPY> The deal includes popular brands such as Pilsner Urquell, Tyskie, Lech, Dreher, Ursus, Timisoreana and Kozel.
<SPLIT> In 1855, two English scientists, Joseph Dalton Hooker and Edward William Binney, made the first scientific description of coal balls in England, and the initial research on coal balls was carried out in Europe. <COPY> North American coal balls were discovered and identified in 1922. <REPHRASE> Coal balls have since been found in other countries, leading to the discovery of hundreds of species and genera. <REPHRASE> Coal balls may be found in coal seams across North America and Eurasia. <REPHRASE> North American coal balls are more widespread, both stratigraphically and geologically, than those in Europe. <REPHRASE> The oldest known coal balls date from the Namurian stage of the Carboniferous; they were found in Germany and on the territory of former Czechoslovakia. <SPLIT> Marie Stopes and David Watson analysed coal ball samples and decided that coal balls formed "in situ". <SPLIT> They stressed the importance of interaction with seawater, believing that it was necessary for the formation of coal balls. <DELETE> Some supporters of the "in situ" theory believe that Stopes' and Watson's discovery of a plant stem extending through multiple coal balls shows that coal balls formed "in situ", stating that the drift theory fails to explain Stopes' and Watson's observation. <SPLIT> They also cite fragile pieces of organic material projecting outside some coal balls, contending that if the drift theory was correct, the projections would have been destroyed, and some large coal balls are large enough that they could never have been able to be transported in the first place. <COPY> Coal balls are not made of coal; they are non-flammable and useless for fuel. <SPLIT> Coal balls are calcium-rich permineralised life forms, mostly containing calcium and magnesium carbonates, pyrite, and quartz. <DELETE> Other minerals, including gypsum, illite, kaolinite, and lepidocrocite also appear in coal balls, albeit in lesser quantities. <SPLIT> Although coal balls are usually about the size of a man's fist, their sizes vary greatly, ranging from that of a walnut up to 3 ft in diameter. <REPHRASE> Coal balls have been found that were smaller than a thimble. <REPHRASE> In 1962, Sergius Mamay and Ellis Yochelson analysed North American coal balls. <DELETE> Their discovery of marine organisms led to classification of coal balls were sorted into three types: normal (sometimes known as floral), containing only plant matter; faunal, containing animal fossils only; and mixed, containing both plant and animal material. <REPHRASE> Mixed coal balls are further divided into heterogeneous, where the plant and animal material was distinctly separated; and homogeneous, lacking that separation. <DELETE> Three main factors determine the quality of preserved material in a coal ball: the mineral constituents, the speed of the burial process, and the degree of compression before undergoing permineralisation. <SPLIT> Generally, coal balls resulting from remains that have a quick burial with little decay and pressure are better preserved, although plant remains in most coal balls almost always show differing signs of decay and collapse. <SPLIT> Coal balls containing quantities of iron sulfide have far lower preservation than coal balls permineralised by magnesium or calcium carbonate, which has earned iron sulfide the title "chief curse of the coal ball hunter". <DELETE> Thin sectioning was an early procedure used to analyse fossilised material contained in coal balls. <DELETE> The process required cutting a coal ball with a diamond saw, then flattening and polishing the thin section with an abrasive. <REPHRASE> It would be glued to a slide and placed under a petrographic microscope for examination. <DELETE> Although the process could be done with a machine, the large amount of time needed and the poor quality of samples produced by thin sectioning gave way to a more convenient method. <DELETE> The thin section technique was superseded by the now-common liquid-peel technique in 1928. <DELETE> In this technique, peels are obtained by cutting the surface of a coal ball with a diamond saw, grinding the cut surface on a glass plate with silicon carbide to a smooth finish, and etching the cut and the surface with hydrochloric acid.

<DELETE> In statistics, a confidence interval (CI) is a type of interval estimate, computed from the statistics of the observed data, that might contain the true value of an unknown population parameter. <DELETE> The interval has an associated confidence level, or coverage that, loosely speaking, quantifies the level of confidence that the deterministic parameter is captured by the interval. <DELETE> More strictly speaking, the confidence level represents the frequency (i.e. the proportion) of possible confidence intervals that contain the true value of the unknown population parameter. <REPHRASE> In other words, if confidence intervals are constructed using a given confidence level from an infinite number of independent sample statistics, the proportion of those intervals that contain the true value of the parameter will be equal to the confidence level. <DELETE> Confidence intervals consist of a range of potential values of the unknown population parameter. <DELETE> However, the interval computed from a particular sample does not necessarily include the true value of the parameter. <DELETE> Based on the (usually taken) assumption that observed data are random samples from a true population, the confidence interval obtained from the data is also random. <DELETE> The confidence level is designated prior to examining the data. <DELETE> Most commonly, the 95% confidence level is used. <REPHRASE> However, other confidence levels can be used, for example, 90% and 99%. <DELETE> Factors affecting the width of the confidence interval include the size of the sample, the confidence level, and the variability in the sample. <DELETE> A larger sample will tend to produce a better estimate of the population parameter, when all other factors are equal. <REPHRASE> A higher confidence level will tend to produce a broader confidence interval. <SPLIT> A machine fills cups with a liquid, and is supposed to be adjusted so that the content of the cups is 250 g of liquid. <SPLIT> As the machine cannot fill every cup with exactly 250.0 g, the content added to individual cups shows some variation, and is considered a random variable X. <DELETE> This variation is assumed to be normally distributed around the desired average of 250 g, with a standard deviation, σ, of 2.5 g. To determine if the machine is adequately calibrated, a sample of "n" = 25 cups of liquid is chosen at random and the cups are weighed. <REPHRASE> The resulting measured masses of liquid are "X", ..., "X", a random sample from "X". <DELETE> To get an impression of the expectation "μ", it is sufficient to give an estimate. <REPHRASE> If we take another sample of 25 cups, we could easily expect to find mean values like 250.4 or 251.1 grams. <DELETE> A sample mean value of 280 grams however would be extremely rare if the mean content of the cups is in fact close to 250 grams. <SPLIT> There is a whole interval around the observed value 250.2 grams of the sample mean within which, if the whole population mean actually takes a value in this range, the observed data would not be considered particularly unusual. <DELETE> Such an interval is called a confidence interval for the parameter "μ". <REPHRASE> How do we calculate such an interval? <DELETE> The endpoints of the interval have to be calculated from the sample, so they are statistics, functions of the sample "X", ..., "X" and hence random variables themselves. <DELETE> dependent on the parameter "μ" to be estimated, but with a standard normal distribution independent of the parameter "μ". <SPLIT> Hence it is possible to find numbers −"z" and "z", independent of "μ", between which "Z" lies with probability 1 − α, a measure of how confident we want to be. <DELETE> We take 1 − α = 0.95, for example. <DELETE> This might be interpreted as: with probability 0.95 we will find a confidence interval in which the value of parameter "μ" will be between the stochastic endpoints <DELETE> This does not mean there is 0.95 probability that the value of parameter "μ" is in the interval obtained by using the currently computed value of the sample mean, <COPY> Instead, every time the measurements are repeated, there will be another value for the mean of the sample. <SPLIT> In 95% of the cases "μ" will be between the endpoints calculated from this mean, but in 5% of the cases it will not be. <DELETE> The actual confidence interval is calculated by entering the measured masses in the formula. <DELETE> As the desired value 250 of "μ" is within the resulted confidence interval, there is no reason to believe the machine is wrongly calibrated. <SPLIT> The calculated interval has fixed endpoints, where μ might be in between (or not). <DELETE> Thus this event has probability either 0 or 1. <DELETE> One cannot say: "with probability (1 − "α") the parameter "μ" lies in the confidence interval." <REPHRASE> One only knows that by repetition in 100(1 − "α")% of the cases, "μ" will be in the calculated interval. <REPHRASE> In 100α% of the cases however it does not. <REPHRASE> And unfortunately one does not know in which of the cases this happens. <DELETE> That is (instead of using the term "probability") why one can say: "with confidence level 100(1 − α) %, "μ" lies in the confidence interval." <REPHRASE> The figure on the right shows 50 realizations of a confidence interval for a given population mean "μ". <REPHRASE> If we randomly choose one realization, the probability is 95% we end up having chosen an interval that contains the parameter; however, we may be unlucky and have picked the wrong one. <COPY> We will never know; we are stuck with our interval.

<SPLIT> The systole is the part of the cardiac cycle during which some chambers of the heart muscle contract after refilling with blood. <SPLIT> The term "systole" originates from New Latin via Ancient Greek συστολή (sustolē): from συστέλλειν (sustellein, "to contract") via [σύν (syn, "together") + στέλλειν (stellein, "send"). <DELETE> The use of systole, "to contract", is very similar to the use of the English term "to squeeze". <SPLIT> When, in late ventricular diastole, the atrial chambers contract, they send blood down to the larger, lower ventricle chambers. <COPY> When normal flow is completed, the ventricles are filled and the valves to the atria are closed. <REPHRASE> The ventricles now perform systole isovolumetrically, which is contraction while all valves are closed—ending the first stage of systole. <REPHRASE> The second stage proceeds immediately, pumping oxygenated blood from the left ventricle through the aortic valve and aorta to all body systems, and simultaneously pumping oxygen-poor blood from the right ventricle through the pulmonic valve and pulmonary artery to the lungs. <REPHRASE> Thus, the pairs of chambers (upper atria and lower ventricles) contract in alternating sequence to each other. <SPLIT> First, atrial contraction feeds blood into the ventricles, then ventricular contraction pumps blood out of the heart to the body systems, including the lungs for resupply of oxygen. <DELETE> When blood pressure is stated for medical purposes, it is usually written with the systolic and diastolic pressures separated by a slash, for example, 120/80 mmHg. <DELETE> This clinical notation is not a mathematical figure for a fraction or ratio, nor a display of a numerator over a denominator.
