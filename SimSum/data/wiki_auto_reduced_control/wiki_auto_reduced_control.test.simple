'Emmeline Pankhurst (née Goulden; 15 July 1858 – 14 June 1928) was the leader of the British suffragette movement which helped women win the right to vote.' 'In 1999 "Time" named Pankhurst as one of the 100 Most Important People of the 20th Century, stating: "she shaped an idea of women for our time; she shook society into a new pattern from which there could be no going back."' "She was widely criticized for her militant tactics, but her work helped to achieve women's suffrage in Britain." 'After her husband died in 1898, Pankhurst founded the Women\'s Social and Political Union (WSPU), an organisation dedicated to "deeds, not words".'  'The group became infamous when its members smashed windows and assaulted police officers.' 'Pankhurst, her daughters, and other WSPU activists were sentenced to repeated prison sentences, where they staged hunger strikes to secure better conditions.' "As Pankhurst's oldest daughter Christabel took the helm of the WSPU, antagonism between the group and the government grew." 'Eventually arson became a common tactic among WSPU members, and more moderate organisations spoke out against the Pankhurst family.' "In 1913 several prominent individuals left the WSPU, among them Pankhurst's daughters Adela and Sylvia."  'The family rift never healed.'  'With the advent of the First World War, Emmeline and Christabel called an immediate halt to militant suffrage activism in support of the British Government\'s stand against the "German Peril".' 'They urged women to aid industrial production and encouraged young men to fight.' 'In 1918 the Representation of the People Act granted votes to women over the age of 30 and the WSPU was disbanded.'  "Pankhurst transformed the WSPU machinery into the Women's Party, dedicated to promoting women's equality in public life." "In her later years she became concerned with the 'Bolshevik menace' and – unhappy with the political alternatives – joined the Conservative Party."   "She died in 1928, 17 days before women got equal voting rights and was commemorated two years later with a statue in London's Victoria Tower Gardens."

García, wanted to challenge what they knew was "the systematic exclusion of persons of Mexican origin" from all types of jury duty in at least seventy counties in Texas.'   'His defense lawyers argued that persons of Mexican descent had not been allowed to serve on juries even though numerous Mexican Americans were citizens and had qualified for jury duty in Jackson County.', 'Even though 14 percent of the county was Hispanic, none had served on juries for at least the last 25 years.' 'This meant Hernandez had been deprived of his Fourteenth Amendment rights.' 'Hernandez and his lawyers appealed to the Supreme Court of Texas, then to the United States Supreme Court through a writ of certiorari.'    'The unanimousmajority opinion was delivered by Chief Justice Earl Warren.' 'The Court ruled the Fourteenth Amendment protects persons beyond the racial classes of white or black, and extends protection to other racial or national groups, as well as legal classes.'

'Gothic pointed arches were also introduced reducing lateral thrust.' 'In particular the 14th century saw bridge construction reaching new heights.' 'Spans of up to 40 m were previously unheard of in masonry arch construction.'  'Stone, brick and other similar materials are strong in compression.', 'They are fairly strong in shear.', 'But they cannot resist much force in tension.' 'As a result, masonry arch bridges are designed to be constantly under compression.' 'Each arch is constructed over a temporary falsework frame, known as a centring.' 'In the first compression arch bridges, a keystone in the middle of the bridge bore the weight of the rest of the bridge.' 'The more weight that was put onto the bridge, the stronger its structure became.' 'Masonry arch bridges use fill material (typically compacted rubble) above the arch in order to increase this dead-weight on the bridge.', 'This also prevents tension from occurring in the arch ring as loads move across the bridge.' 'Unreinforced concrete was also used.' 'When masonry (cut stone) is used, the angles of the faces are cut to minimize shear forces.' 'Where random masonry (uncut and unprepared stones) is used they are mortared together.', 'The mortar is allowed to set before the falsework is removed.'

'Theodor Herzl\'s "Der Judenstaat" argued for a Jewish state in either Palestine, "our ever-memorable historic home", or Argentina, "one of the most fertile countries in the world".'

'Few historians believe that such a settlement idea could have attracted immigrants, received much money in donations, or been supported by many other countries.' 'Because some members of the Zionist leadership liked the idea, however, peace was kept in the movement because they voted to start a committee to look at the possibility.'  'Because of this, the Jewish Territorialist Organization (ITO) led by Israel Zangwill split off from the Zionist movement.' 'It tried to find land where Jews could settle in different parts of America (e.g. Galveston), Africa, Asia, and Australia, but with little success.' 'They did not officially say no to the idea until the Seventh Zionist Congress in 1905.'        'Apart from the (ITO), within the USSR there was also a Territorialist effort in Ukraine, the Crimea and then in a region around Birobidzhan, where a Jewish Autonomous Region was started in 1934.'

'One of the more well-known tries was the Kimberley Plan, to get land in Australia.'  'After the State of Israel was created in 1948, Steinberg had criticized the exclusivist politics of the Zionist government and continued his attempts to create a non-nationalist Jewish settlement in some other part of the world.'

'An undulator is an insertion device from high-energy physics and usually part of a larger installation, a synchrotron storage ring.' 'It consists of a periodic structure of dipole magnets.'  'A static magnetic field is alternating along the length of the undulator with a wavelength formula_1.' 'Electrons traversing the periodic magnet structure are forced to undergo oscillations.' 'The radiation produced in an undulator is very intense and concentrated in narrow energy bands in the spectrum.' 'The light beam is also collimated on the orbit plane of the electrons.' 'This radiation is guided through beamlines for experiments in various scientific areas.' 'where "e" is the particle charge, "B" is the magnetic field, "formula_3", "formula_4" is the electron rest mass and "c" is the speed of light, characterizes the nature of the electron motion.'  'For formula_5 the oscillation amplitude of the motion is small and the radiation displays interference patterns which lead to narrow energy bands.' 'If formula_6 the oscillation amplitude is bigger and the radiation contributions from each field period sum up independently, leading to a broad energy spectrum.' 'When K is much bigger than 1, the device is no longer called an "undulator"; it is called a wiggler.'  'This means that though the precision calculation is tedious the undulator can be seen as a black box.', 'An electron enters this box and an electromagnetic pulse exits through a small exit slit.' 'The slit should be small enough so that only the main cone passes, so that the side lobes may be ignored.' 'Undulators can provide hundreds of time more magnetic flux than a simple bending magnet and as such are in high demand at synchrotron radiation facilities.' 'For an undulator that repeat N times (N periods), the brightness can be up to formula_7 more than a bending magnet.' 'The intensity is enhanced up to a factor of N at harmonic wavelengths due to the constructive interference of the fields emitted during the N radiation periods.' 'The usual pulse is a sine wave with some envelope.' 'The second factor of N comes from the reduction of the emission angle associated with these harmonics, which is reduced in proportion to 1/N.' 'When the electrons come with half the period, they interfere destructively.', 'So, the undulator stays dark.' 'The same is true if the electrons come as a bead chain.' 'The polarization of the emitted radiation can be controlled by using permanent magnets to induce different periodic electron trajectories through the undulator.' 'If the oscillations are confined to a plane the radiation will be linearly polarized.' 'If the oscillation trajectory is helical, the radiation will be circularly polarized, with the handedness determined by the helix.' 'If the electrons follow the Poisson distribution, a partial interference leads to a linear increase in intensity.' 'In the free-electron laser the intensity increases exponentially with the number of electrons.' "Physicists measure an undulator's effectiveness in terms of spectral radiance." 'The Russian physicist V.L. Ginzburg showed that undulators could be made in principle in a 1947 paper.'   'The first undulator was built by Hans Motz and his coworkers at Stanford in 1953.' 'One of their undulators produced the first ever coherent infrared radiation.' 'Their total frequency range was from visible light down to millimeter waves.'

  'For example, every natural number has another natural number larger than it.' 'Two basic kinds of quantifiers used in predicate logic are universal and existential quantifiers.'   'Quantifiers are also used in natural languages.', 'Examples of quantifiers in English are "for all", "for some", "many", "few", "a lot", and "no".'  'This is a problem for formal languages, since a formal statement needs to be finite in length.' 'The two quantifiers most widely used are the universal quantifier and the existence quantifier.' 'The universal quantifier is symbolized with "∀", an upside down "A", to stand for "all".' 'An existence quantifier (symbolized with "∃") states that at least one element considered fits the criteria.', 'The existential quantifier is symbolized with "∃", a backwards "E", to stand for "exists".'  'We can rewrite an example English statement with symbols, predicates representing criteria, and quantifiers.', 'The example is "Each of Peter\'s friends either likes to dance or likes to go to the beach".' 'Let "X" be the set of all Peter\'s friends.', 'Let "P"("x") be the predicate ""x" likes to dance".', 'Let "Q"("x") be the predicate ""x" likes to go to the beach".' 'We can rewrite the example using formal notation as formula_1.', 'The statement can be read as "for every "x" that is a member of "X", "P" applies to "x" or "Q" applies to "x"."' 'It states that every natural number has a square.' 'However, if we turn the order of the quantifiers around: This statement is false.', 'It claims that there is one natural number "s" that is the square of "every" natural number.'   'The solution quantifier is represented by a § (section sign).'   'The use of quantification was closer to that of natural language.', 'This meant that statements in term logic with quantifiers were less suited for formal analysis.' 'Term logic included quantifiers for "All", "Some" and "No" (none) in 4th century BC.' 'In 1879, Gottlob Frege created a notation for universal quantification.' 'Unlike today, he would represent a universal quantification by writing a variable over a dimple in an otherwise straight line.' 'Frege did not create a notation for existential quantification.' 'Frege\'s use of quantification was not widely known until Bertrand Russell\'s 1903 "Principles of Mathematics".' 'In 1885, Charles Sanders Peirce and his student Oscar Howard Mitchell also created a notation for universal and existential quantifiers.' 'They wrote Π and Σ where we now write ∀"x" and ∃"x".' "Pierce's notation was used by many mathematicians into the 1950s."  'In 1897, William Ernest Johnson and Giuseppe Peano created another notation for universal and existential quantification.', 'Johnson and Peano used the simple ("x") for universal quantification, and ∃"x" for existential quantification.'    'In 1935, Gerhard Gentzen created the ∀ symbol for universal quantification.' 'It was not widely used until the 1960s.'

'Halophiles are organisms that need salt in their environment to live.'  'The name "halophile" comes from Greek for "salt-loving".' 'Most halophiles are archaeans, but some bacteria and eukaryotes are also halophiles, such as the alga "Dunaliella salina".'  'Halophiles live in evaporation ponds or salt lakes such as Great Salt Lake, Owens Lake, or Dead Sea.' 'Halophiles are categorized by the levels of salt at which they grow best.', 'Halophiles can either be categorized as slight halophiles, moderate halophiles, or extreme halophiles.' 'Slight halophiles grow best in concentrations of salt around 2% to 5%.', 'Moderate halophiles grow best in concentrations of salt around 5% to 20%.', 'Extreme halophiles grow best in concentrations of salt from 20% to 30%.'   'Most halophilic and salt-eating animals use energy to remove salt from their cytoplasm.' 'To get to this state, halophiles use two different methods.'  'In the first (mainly used by bacteria, some archaea, yeasts, algae and fungi), organic compounds are stored in the cytoplasm.'  'The most commonly used solutes for this process are neutral and include amino acids and sugars.' 'The second, less common adaptation, is the selective intake of potassium (K) ions into the cytoplasm.'   'The main disadvantage to this adaption is that all of the machinery inside the cell (enzymes, structural proteins, etc.) must be adapted to high levels of non-organic ions, and high salt levels.'

'The Peak District is an upland area in England at the southern end of the Pennines.' 'It is mostly in northern Derbyshire but also includes parts of Cheshire, Greater Manchester, Staffordshire and Yorkshire.' "The northern 'Dark Peak' is where most of the moorland is found." 'The Peak District National Park became the first national park in the United Kingdom in 1951.' 'It attracts many visitors every year.'   'Much of the area is uplands above 1000 ft, with a high point on Kinder Scout of 2087 ft. Despite its name, the landscape generally lacks sharp peaks, but has rounded hills and gritstone escarpments (the "edges").' 'The area is surrounded by major conurbations, including Huddersfield, Manchester, Sheffield, Derby and Stoke-on-Trent.' 'The Peak District is formed almost exclusively from sedimentary rocks dating from the Carboniferous period.' 'They comprise the Carboniferous limestone, the overlying gritstone and finally the coal measures at the margins of the area.', 'There are outcrops of igneous rocks including lavas, tuffs and volcanic vent agglomerates.'      'Earth movements after the Carboniferous period resulted in the up-doming of the area.' 'This resulted in the dome-like shape.', 'The shale and sandstone were worn away until limestone was exposed.' "At the end of this period, the Earth's crust sank here which led to the area being covered by sea, depositing a variety of new rocks." 'Some time after its deposition, mineral veins were formed in the limestone.' 'These veins and rakes have been mined for lead since Roman times.' 'The Peak District was covered by ice during at least one of the ice ages of the last 2 million years.'   'Glacial meltwaters eroded a complex of sinuous channels along the margin of the Peak District during this period.' 'Glacial meltwaters helped form many of the caves in the limestone area.' 'Wild animal herds roamed the area, and their remains have been found in several of the local caves.' 'The different types of rock that lie beneath the soil strongly influence the landscape.', 'They determine the vegetation and so the animals that will live in the area.' 'Limestone has fissures (cracks) and is soluble in water, so rivers carve deep, narrow valleys.' 'These rivers then often find a route underground, creating cave systems.' 'Millstone Grit on the other hand is insoluble but porous, so it absorbs water.', 'Water moves through the grits until it meets the less porous shales beneath, creating springs when it reaches the surface again.' 'The shales are friable and easily attacked by frost.', 'They form areas where landslides may occur, as on Mam Tor.'

'Observations of IC 10 in the far-infrared show that the dust in this mild starburst galaxy is deficient in small grains.' 'Perhaps small grains were destroyed by strong ultraviolet radiation in the areas around the hot luminous stars.' 'The galaxy has a huge envelope of hydrogen gas, with an apparent size measuring 68′ × 80′, which is far larger than the apparent size of the galaxy in visible light (5.5′ × 7.0′).'

'After graduating from secondary school, in 1847 he entered the University of Giessen, with the intention of studying architecture.' 'After hearing the lectures of Justus von Liebig he decided to study chemistry.'

'In 1865 Kekulé published a paper in French suggesting that the structure contained a six-membered ring of carbon atoms with alternating single and double bonds.' 'The next year he published a much longer paper in German on the same subject.' 'The empirical formula for benzene had been long known, but its highly unsaturated structure was challenging to determine.' 'Archibald Scott Couper in 1858 and Joseph Loschmidt in 1861 suggested possible structures that contained multiple double bonds or multiple rings, but the study of aromatic compounds was in its earliest years, and too little evidence was then available to help chemists decide on any particular structure.'

'Their semi-major axes range between 16 and 19 Gm, their inclinations between 35° and 40°, and their eccentricities around 0.53.' 'The International Astronomical Union (IAU) reserves names taken from Gallic mythology for these moons.' 'Similar mean orbital elements led the discoverers to postulate a common origin for the group in a break up of a larger body.' 'The group was later found to be physically homogenous, all satellites displaying "light-red" colour (colour indices B − V = 0.91 and V − R = 0.48) and similar infrared indices' 'Remarkably, recent observations revealed that the largest member of the group, Albiorix, displays actually two different colours: one compatible with Eriapo and Tarvos, and another less red.' 'Instead of the common progenitor, it was postulated that Tarvos and Erriapus could be fragments of Albiorix, leaving a large, less red crater.' 'Such an impact would require a body with the diameter in excess of 1 km and relative velocity close to 5 km/s, resulting in a large crater with the radius of 12 km.' "Numerous, very large craters observed on Phoebe, prove the existence of such collisions in the Saturnian system's past."
'The International Opium Convention was the first drug control treaty (or agreement).', 'It was signed at The Hague in The Netherlands on January 23, 1912.'

'The Convention was implemented in 1915 by the United States, Netherlands, China, Honduras, and Norway.' 'It went into force around the world in 1919 when it became part of the Treaty of Versailles.'   'A modified International Opium Convention was signed on February 19, 1925, which started on September 25, 1928.' 'It introduced control system to be looked after by a Permanent Central Opium Board, part of the League of Nations.' 'Egypt, with support from China and United States, recommended that a ban on hashish be added to the Convention, and a sub-committee proposed the following text: The use of Indian hemp and the preparations derived therefrom may only be authorized for medical and scientific purposes.' 'The raw resin (charas), however, which is extracted from the female tops of the cannabis sativa L, together with the various preparations (hashish, chira, esrar, diamba, etc.) of which it forms the basis, not being at present utilized for medical purposes and only being susceptible of utilisation for harmful purposes, in the same manner as other narcotics, may not be produced, sold, traded in, etc., under any circumstances whatsoever.' 'India and other countries did not agree to this language, saying social and religious customs and that wild-growing cannabis plants being available in many places, that would make it difficult to enforce, so this never made it into the final treaty.'  'A compromise was made that banned the export of "Indian hemp" to countries that have banned its use.', 'Importing countries were made to issue certificates approving the import and stating that the shipment was required "exclusively for medical or scientific purposes."' 'It also required Parties to "exercise an effective control of such a nature as to prevent the illicit international traffic in Indian hemp and especially in the resin."' 'These restrictions still made it easy for countries to allow production, internal trade, and use of cannabis for recreational purposes.' 'The Convention was superseded by the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs.'
'An ecosystem is a large community of living organisms (plants, animals and microbes) in a particular area.' 'The living and physical components are linked together through nutrient cycles and energy flows.'     'What drives all ecosystems is the primary production.', 'Primary production is the production of organic matter from inorganic carbon sources.' 'This happens through photosynthesis.'  'It drives the carbon cycle, which influences global climate via the greenhouse effect.' 'Through the process of photosynthesis, plants capture energy from light and use it to combine carbon dioxide and water to produce carbohydrates and oxygen.' 'The photosynthesis carried out by all the plants in an ecosystem is called the gross primary production (GPP).' 'About 48–60% of the GPP is consumed in plant respiration.' 'The rest is known as the net primary production (NPP).' 'Total photosynthesis is limited by a range of environmental factors.' 'These include the amount of light available, the amount of leaf area a plant has to capture light (shading by other plants limits photosynthesis), the supply of carbon dioxide and water, and suitable temperatures for carrying out photosynthesis.' 'Ecosystems are stable, but not rigid.'

'John Forrest Dillon (December 25, 1831 – May 6, 1914) was an American judge.' 'He wrote an important book on the power of states about municipal governments.' 'Dillon was born in Northampton, Montgomery County, New York.'  'Shortly after beginning to work as a doctor, he switched to studying law, and was admitted to the Iowa bar in 1852.' "He was elected as the Scott County prosecutor after a brief private practice in 1853, and was then elected to a judgeship in Iowa's 7th Judicial Circuit in 1858."  'He joined to the Iowa Supreme Court in 1862 and served until 1869, when he was appointed by President Grant to the United States Circuit Court.' 'While Dillon was a federal judge, he wrote "Municipal Corporations" (1872), which was one of the earliest books to present the subject, and people still study it today.' 'He was also the author of "Removal of Cases from State Courts to Federal Courts" and "Municipal Bonds", both in 1876.' "On February 17, 1876, Justice Dillon ruled Ulysses S. Grant's deposition for Orville E. Babcock was admissible in court during the Whiskey Ring graft prosecutions." 'After leaving the Circuit Court, Dillon was a professor at Columbia Law School from 1879 until 1882, where he taught real estate and equity.'  'He then taught at Yale Law School from 1891 until 1892.' 'Dillon then returned to private practice until his death in 1914 in New York City.' 'A memorial fountain to Dillon was built in downtown Davenport, Iowa in 1918.', 'Sculptor Harry Liva carved it out of Indiana limestone in Romanesque style.'    "Dillon's oldest son, Hiram Price Dillon (1855 – 1918), also became a lawyer in Iowa, and a Master of Chancery in federal court."    'The theory of state preeminence over local governments was called the "Dillon Rule" in an 1868 case: "Municipal corporations owe their origin to, and derive their powers and rights wholly from, the legislature.' 'It breathes into them the breath of life, without which they cannot exist.' 'As it creates, so may it destroy.' 'If it may destroy, it may abridge and control."' 'As opposed to the Dillon Rule, the Cooley Doctrine expressed the theory of an inherent right to local self-determination.' 'In a concurring opinion, Michigan Supreme Court Judge Thomas M. Cooley in 1871 stated: “Local government is a matter of absolute right; and the state cannot take it away.”' 'In "Municipal Corporations" (1872), Dillon explained that in contrast to the powers of states, which are unlimited but for express restrictions under the state or federal constitution, municipalities only have the powers that the state legislature expressly gives to them.' 'This formulation of the scope of municipal power came to be known as the "Dillon Rule".' "It says that municipal governments only have the powers that are expressly granted to them by the state legislature, those that are necessarily implied from that grant of power, and those that are essential and indispensable to the municipality's existence and functioning." 'If the legislative grant of power is unclear, it should be read narrowly.' 'However, when the state has not specifically directed the method by which the municipality may implement its granted power, the municipality has the discretion to choose the method so long as its choice is reasonable.' 'The Supreme Court of the United States cited Dillon\'s book "Municipal Corporations" and fully adopted Dillon\'s emphasis on state power over municipalities in "Merrill v. Monticello," 138 U.S. 673 (1891), reaff\'d.', '"Hunter v. Pittsburgh", 207 U.S. 161 (1907), which upheld the power of Pennsylvania to consolidate the city of Allegheny into the city of Pittsburgh, despite the wishes of the majority of Allegheny residents to be a separate city.' "The Court's ruling that states could alter or abolish at will the charters of municipal corporations without infringing upon contract rights relied upon Dillon's separation of public, municipal corporations from private ones."   'Hundreds of U.S. court decisions to the present day have employed the Dillon Rule to determine the scope of municipal powers and rights.' 'Critics of the rule say that it imposes unreasonable constraints on the ability of communities to govern themselves and so undermines democracy, and even that local self-government is a matter of natural right that does not need to be conferred by higher political structures.' "It has also been suggested that Dillon's approach came from the view at that time that cities were inherently corrupt political organs." 'Today, most states in the United States follow the Dillon Rule.'

'This year February 28 days in it.' 'February is a winter month in the Northern Hemisphere and a summer month in the Southern Hemisphere.' 'In each hemisphere, it is the seasonal equivalent of August in the other.' 'The name comes either from the Roman god Februus or else from "februa", the festivals of purification celebrated in Rome every fifteenth of this month.' 'February is one of the last two months to be added to the calendar at the beginning of the year (the other is January).'    'February is also the only month of the calendar that, once every six years and twice every 11 years consecutively, either back into the past or forward into the future, will have four full 7-day weeks.' 'In countries that start their week on a Monday, it occurs as part of a common year starting on Friday, in which February 1st is a Monday and the 28th is a Sunday, this was observed in 2010 and can be traced back 11 years to 1999, 6 years back to 1993, 11 years back to 1982, 11 years back to 1971 and 6 years back to 1965, and will be observed in 2021.'

'The Turin King List, also called the Turin Royal Canon, is a list of the kings of Egypt.', 'The list is now in the Egyptian Museum in Turin.' 'The papyrus is the most complete list of kings written by the Egyptians.', 'It is the basis working out the dates of kings before the rule of Ramesses II.' 'It is thought to date from the rule of Pharaoh Ramesses II.', 'The papyrus is believed to have been written in the time of Ramesses II, during the middle of the New Kingdom, or the 19th Dynasty.' 'The beginning and ending of the list are lost.', 'There is no introduction, and the list stops after the 19th Dynasty.' 'It may have been written at any later time, from Ramesses II to as late as the 20th Dynasty.' 'The papyrus lists the names of rulers, the lengths of their rule in years, with months and days for some kings.' 'In some cases they are grouped together by family.', 'This grouping is almost the same as the dynasties of Manetho’s book.' 'The list includes the names of kings who only ruled for a very short time, or those ruling small areas that may not be in listed in other sources.' 'The list also is believed to contain kings from the 15th Dynasty, the Hyksos who ruled Lower Egypt and the River Nile delta.' 'The Hyksos rulers do not have cartouches (borders around the name of a king).', 'They do have a hieroglyphic sign to show that they were foreigners.' 'The papyrus was a tax roll, but on its back is written a list of rulers of Egypt.', 'It includes the mythical kings such as gods, demi-gods, and spirits, as well as human kings.' 'As the papyrus was reused for the tax roll, it shows the list was not of great formal importance to the writer.', 'The list is thought to have been used as an administrative aid.' 'As such, the papyrus is not supposed to be biased against certain rulers and is believed to include all the kings of Egypt up through at least the 19th Dynasty.' 'The papyrus was found by the Italian traveler Bernardino Drovetti in 1820 at Luxor (Thebes).', 'In 1824 was put in the Egyptian Museum in Turin, Italy, and known as Papyrus Number 1874.' 'When the box in which it had been taken to Italy was unpacked, the list had broken up into small pieces.' 'Jean-Francois Champollion could read only some of the larger pieces which had royal names.'  'The Saxon researcher Gustav Seyffarth (1796–1885) looked carefully at some of the pieces, some only one square centimeter in size.', 'He made a more complete reconstruction of the papyrus based only on the papyrus fibers, as he could not read the hieratic characters.' "Later work by the Munich Egyptologist Jens Peter Lauth, largely agreed with Seyffarth's work." 'In 1997 Egyptologist Kim Ryholt published a new version of the list in his book, "The Political Situation in Egypt during the Second Intermediate Period c.1800-1550 B.C." Egyptologist Donald Redford has also studied the papyrus and has noted that many of the list’s names match historic monuments and other documents.' 'The list may not be completely accurate for pre-Ramesses II chronology.' 'About 50% of the papyrus is missing.' 'It is 1.7 m long and 0.41 m wide, broken into over 160 pieces.' 'In 2009 new pieces were discovered in the storage room of the Egyptian Museum of Turin, in good condition.' 'A new edition of the papyrus is expected.' 'The name Hudjefa, is listed twice in the papyrus.', 'The name is now known to have been used by the royal scribes of Ramesses II when the name of a king was unreadable or missing.' 'The papyrus is divided into eleven columns.' 'The names and positions of several kings are still uncertain as the list is so badly damaged.'

'In 1855, two English scientists, Joseph Dalton Hooker and Edward William Binney, found coal balls in England.', 'Because of that, the initial research on coal balls was done in Europe.' 'Coal balls were found and identified in North America in 1922.' 'Since then, coal balls have been found in other countries and several theories on their formation have been proposed.' 'Coal balls are in coal seams across North America and Eurasia.' 'North American coal balls are in more places than in Europe.' 'The oldest coal balls were found in Germany and former Czechoslovakia.' 'Marie Stopes and D.M.S. Watson also examined coal ball samples.', 'They agreed that coal balls formed "in situ".' 'They also added that interaction with a marine environment was necessary for a coal ball to form.'   'Coal balls are not made of coal, even though they have the name "coal ball".' 'Coal balls are permineralised life forms that are full of calcium, magnesium and occasionally iron sulfide.'    'In 1962, Sergius Mamay and Ellis Yochelson found signs of marine animal remains in North American coal balls.'   'The quality of the preservation of organic material depends on the speed of the burial process and the degree of compression before undergoing permineralisation.' 'Generally, coal balls resulting from remains that have a quick burial with little decay and pressure have a higher preservation degree.', 'However, plant remains in most coal balls show various signs of decay and collapse.'  'Thin sectioning was an early procedure used to analyse fossilised material contained in coal balls.' 'The ball was cut into thin sections with a diamond saw.', 'Then it was flattened and polished with an abrasive.' 'Then it was examined under a microscope.' 'The time needed, and the poor quality of samples produced, led to a more convenient method.' 'The new method, first used in 1928, is called the "liquid peel technique".'

'In statistics a confidence interval is a special form of estimating a certain parameter.'  'The likelihood that the parameter will be in the interval is called confidence level.'    'The confidence interval is based on the observations from a sample, and hence differs from sample to sample.'  'People may speak about the "95% confidence interval".', 'In common usage, a claim to 95% confidence in something is normally taken as indicating virtual certainty.'    'For a given estimation procedure in a given situation, the higher the confidence level, the wider the confidence interval will be.' 'A machine fills cups with margarine.', 'For the example, the machine is adjusted so that the content of the cups is 250g of margarine.' 'As the machine cannot fill every cup with exactly 250g, the content added to individual cups shows some variation, and is considered a random variable X.' 'This variation is assumed to be normally distributed around the desired average of 250g, with a standard deviation of 2.5g. To determine if the machine is adequately calibrated, a sample of "n" = 25 cups of margarine is chosen at random and the cups are weighed.' 'The weights of margarine are "X", ..., "X", a random sample from "X".' 'To get an impression of the expectation μ, it is sufficient to give an estimate.' 'If we take another sample of 25 cups, we could easily expect to find values like 250.4 or 251.1 grams.' 'A sample mean value of 280 grams however would be extremely rare if the mean content of the cups is in fact close to 250g.' 'There is a whole interval around the observed value 250.2 of the sample mean within which, if the whole population mean actually takes a value in this range, the observed data would not be considered particularly unusual.' 'Such an interval is called a confidence interval for the parameter "μ".' 'How do we calculate such an interval?' 'The endpoints of the interval have to be calculated from the sample, so they are statistics, functions of the sample "X", ..., "X" and hence random variables themselves.' 'dependent on the parameter μ to be estimated, but with a standard normal distribution independent of the parameter "μ".' 'Hence it is possible to find numbers −"z" and "z", independent of "μ", where "Z" lies in between with probability 1 − α, a measure of how confident we want to be.' 'We take 1 - α = 0.95.' 'This might be interpreted as: with probability 0.95 we will find a confidence interval in which we will meet the parameter "μ" between the stochastic endpoints' 'This does not mean that there is 0.95 probability of meeting the parameter μ in the calculated interval.' 'Every time the measurements are repeated, there will be another value for the mean of the sample.' 'In 95% of the cases "μ" will be between the endpoints calculated from this mean, but in 5% of the cases it will not be.' 'The actual confidence interval is calculated by entering the measured weights in the formula.' 'As the desired value 250 of "μ" is within the resulted confidence interval, there is no reason to believe the machine is wrongly calibrated.' 'The calculated interval has fixed endpoints, where μ might be in between (or not).' 'Thus this event has probability either 0 or 1.' 'We cannot say: "with probability (1 − α) the parameter "μ" lies in the confidence interval."' 'We only know that by repetition in 100(1 − α) % of the cases μ will be in the calculated interval.' 'In 100α % of the cases however it does not.' 'And unfortunately we do not know in which of the cases this happens.' 'That\'s why we say: "with confidence level 100(1 − α) %, "μ" lies in the confidence interval."' 'The figure on the right shows 50 realisations of a confidence interval for a given population mean μ.' 'If we randomly choose one realisation, the probability is 95% we end up having chosen an interval that contains the parameter; however we may be unlucky and have picked the wrong one.' "We'll never know; we are stuck with our interval."
