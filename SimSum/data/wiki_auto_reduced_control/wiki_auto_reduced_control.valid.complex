<DELETE> Historians and political scientists consider the Second Party System to be a term of periodization to designate the political party system operating in the United States from about 1828 to 1854, after the First Party System ended. <DELETE> The system was characterized by rapidly rising levels of voter interest, beginning in 1828, as demonstrated by Election Day turnouts, rallies, partisan newspapers, and high degrees of personal loyalty to parties. <SPLIT> Two major parties dominated the political landscape: the Democratic Party, led by Andrew Jackson, and the Whig Party, assembled by Henry Clay from the National Republicans and from other opponents of Jackson. <DELETE> Minor parties included the Anti-Masonic Party, an important innovator from 1827 to 1834; the abolitionist Liberty Party in 1840; and the anti-slavery expansion Free Soil Party in 1848 and 1852. <DELETE> The Second Party System reflected and shaped the political, social, economic and cultural currents of the Jacksonian Era, until succeeded by the Third Party System. <REPHRASE> Historian Richard P. McCormick is most responsible for defining the term. <REPHRASE> Among the best-known figures on the Democratic side were: Andrew Jackson, Martin Van Buren, John C. Calhoun, James K. Polk, Lewis Cass, and Stephen Douglas. <COPY> On the Whig side were John Quincy Adams, Henry Clay, Daniel Webster, William H. Seward, and Thurlow Weed. <REPHRASE> The 1824 presidential election operated without political parties and came down to a four-man race. <DELETE> Each candidate (Henry Clay, William Crawford, Andrew Jackson, and John Quincy Adams), all of whom were nominally Democratic Republicans, had a regional base of support involving factions in the various states. <DELETE> With no electoral college majority, the choice devolved on the United States House of Representatives. <SPLIT> Clay was not among the three finalists, but as Speaker of the House he negotiated the settlement. <SPLIT> Jackson, despite having won the most popular votes and the most electoral votes, was not elected. <REPHRASE> John Quincy Adams, son of former President John Adams, was elected, and he immediately chose Clay as Secretary of State. <REPHRASE> Jackson loudly denounced this "corrupt bargain." <REPHRASE> Campaigning vigorously he launched a crusade against the corruption he saw in Washington. <SPLIT> Appealing both to local militia companies (as the most famous of the nation's Indian fighters, and a hero of the War of 1812) and to state political factions, Jackson assembled a coalition, the embryonic Democratic Party, that ousted Adams in 1828. <DELETE> Martin Van Buren, brilliant leader of New York politics, was Jackson's key aide, bringing along the large electoral votes of Virginia and Pennsylvania. <SPLIT> His reward was appointment as Secretary of State and later nomination and election to the vice presidency as heir to the Jacksonian tradition. <REPHRASE> The Adams-Clay wing of the Democratic-Republican Party became known as the National Republicans, although Adams never considered himself a loyal member of the party. <SPLIT> Jackson considered himself a reformer, but he was committed to the old ideals of Republicanism, and bitterly opposed anything that smacked of special favors for special interests. <SPLIT> While Jackson never engaged in a duel as president, he had shot political opponents before and was just as determined to destroy his enemies on the battlefields of politics. <REPHRASE> The Second Party System came about primarily because of Jackson's determination to destroy the Second Bank of the United States. <REPHRASE> Headquartered in Philadelphia, with offices in major cities around the country, the federally chartered Bank operated somewhat like a central bank (like the Federal Reserve System a century later). <REPHRASE> Local bankers and politicians annoyed by the controls exerted by Nicholas Biddle grumbled loudly. <DELETE> Jackson did not like any banks (paper money was anathema to Jackson; he believed only gold and silver "specie" should circulate.) <REPHRASE> After Herculean battles with Henry Clay, his chief antagonist, Jackson finally broke Biddle's bank. <COPY> Jackson continued to attack the banking system. <DELETE> His "Specie Circular" of July 1836 rejected paper money issued by banks (it could no longer be used to buy federal land), insisting on gold and silver coins. <SPLIT> Most businessmen and bankers (but not all) went over to the Whig party, and the commercial and industrial cities became Whig strongholds. <REPHRASE> Jackson meanwhile became even more popular with the subsistence farmers and day laborers who distrusted bankers and finance. <REPHRASE> Jackson systematically used the federal patronage system, what was called the "Spoils System". <COPY> Jackson not only rewarded past supporters; he promised future jobs if local and state politicians joined his team. <REPHRASE> As Syrett explains: When Jackson became President, he implemented the theory of rotation in office, declaring it "a leading principle in the republican creed." <DELETE> He believed that rotation in office would prevent the development of a corrupt civil service. <DELETE> On the other hand, Jackson's supporters wanted to use the civil service to reward party loyalists to make the party stronger. <REPHRASE> In practice, this meant replacing civil servants with friends or party loyalists into those offices. <REPHRASE> The spoils system did not originate with Jackson. <DELETE> It originated under Thomas Jefferson when he removed Federalist office-holders after becoming president. <REPHRASE> Also, Jackson did not out the entire civil service. <REPHRASE> At the end of his term, Jackson had only dismissed less than twenty percent of the original civil service. <DELETE> While Jackson did not start the spoils system, he did encourage its growth and it became a central feature of the Second Party System, as well as the Third Party System, until it ended in the 1890s. <REPHRASE> As one historian explains: "Although Jackson dismissed far fewer government employees than most of his contemporaries imagined and although he did not originate the spoils system, he made more sweeping changes in the Federal bureaucracy than had any of his predecessors.

<SPLIT> A (named , plural "As", "A's", "a"s, "a's" or "aes" ) is the first letter and the first vowel of the modern English alphabet and the ISO basic Latin alphabet. <REPHRASE> It is similar to the Ancient Greek letter alpha, from which it derives. <REPHRASE> The uppercase version consists of the two slanting sides of a triangle, crossed in the middle by a horizontal bar. <REPHRASE> The lowercase version can be written in two forms: the double-storey a and single-storey ɑ. <DELETE> The latter is commonly used in handwriting and fonts based on it, especially fonts intended to be read by children, and is also found in italic type. <SPLIT> The earliest certain ancestor of "A" is aleph (also written 'aleph), the first letter of the Phoenician alphabet, which consisted entirely of consonants (for that reason, it is also called an abjad to distinguish it from a true alphabet). <SPLIT> In turn, the ancestor of aleph may have been a pictogram of an ox head in proto-Sinaitic script influenced by Egyptian hieroglyphs, styled as a triangular head with two horns extended. <SPLIT> By 1600 BC, the Phoenician alphabet letter had a linear form that served as the base for some later forms. <REPHRASE> Its name is thought to have corresponded closely to the Paleo-Hebrew or Arabic aleph. <SPLIT> When the ancient Greeks adopted the alphabet, they had no use for a letter to represent the glottal stop—the consonant sound that the letter denoted in Phoenician and other Semitic languages, and that was the first phoneme of the Phoenician pronunciation of the letter—so they used their version of the sign to represent the vowel /a/ , and called it by the similar name of alpha. <SPLIT> In the earliest Greek inscriptions after the Greek Dark Ages, dating to the 8th century BC, the letter rests upon its side, but in the Greek alphabet of later times it generally resembles the modern capital letter, although many local varieties can be distinguished by the shortening of one leg, or by the angle at which the cross line is set. <REPHRASE> The Etruscans brought the Greek alphabet to their civilization in the Italian Peninsula and left the letter unchanged. <SPLIT> The Romans later adopted the Etruscan alphabet to write the Latin language, and the resulting letter was preserved in the Latin alphabet that would come to be used to write many languages, including English. <SPLIT> In algebra, the letter "a" along with other letters at the beginning of the alphabet is used to represent known quantities, whereas the letters at the end of the alphabet ("x", "y", "z") are used to denote unknown quantities. <REPHRASE> In geometry, capital A, B, C etc. are used to denote segments, lines, rays, etc. <REPHRASE> A capital A is also typically used as one of the letters to represent an angle in a triangle, the lowercase a representing the side opposite angle A.

dynastical title. <DELETE> Rival claims to the title have been made by German emperors and kings of the House of Hohenzollern and by the head of the French noble family of Mailly. <DELETE> The current users of the title are Princess Catharina-Amalia of the Netherlands (Orange-Nassau), Georg Friedrich, Prince of Prussia (Hohenzollern), and Guy, Marquis de Mailly-Nesle (Mailly). <DELETE> The title originally referred to Orange in the Vaucluse department in the Rhone valley of southern France, which was a property of the House of Orange, then of the House of Baux and the House of Châlon-Arlay before passing in 1544 to the House of Orange-Nassau. <SPLIT> The last descendant of the original princes, René of Châlon, left the principality to his cousin William the Silent, who was not a descendant of the original Orange family but the heir to the principality of Orange by testament, however in violation against the inheritance pattern enacted by the last will of Marie des Baux, the Princess of Orange through kinship to whom Prince René derived his own right thereto. <DELETE> In 1673, Louis XIV of France annexed all territory of the principality to France and to the royal domain, as part of the war actions against the stadtholder William III of Orange — who later became King William III of Great Britain. <REPHRASE> Orange ceased to exist as a sovereign realm, de facto. <REPHRASE> After the marquis (who died in 1713), the next holder was , marquis de Nesle (1689–1764). <SPLIT> Although no longer descended from Louis-Charles, a branch of the Mailly family still claim the title today. <DELETE> In 1714 Louis XIV bestowed the usufruct of the principality on his kinsman, Louis Armand of Bourbon, Prince de Conti. <REPHRASE> After his death in 1727 the principality was deemed merged in the Crown by 1731. <REPHRASE> Because William III died without legitimate children, the principality was regarded as having been inherited by his closest cognate relative on the basis of the testament of Frederic-Henry, Frederick I of Prussia, who ceded the principality — at least the lands, but not the formal title — to France in 1713. <COPY> France supported his claim. <REPHRASE> In this way, the territory of the principality lost its feudal and secular privileges and became a part of France. <DELETE> The Treaty of Utrecht allowed the King of Prussia to erect part of the duchy of Gelderland (the cities of Geldern, Straelen and Wachtendonk with their bailiwicks, Krickenbeck, Viersen, the land of Kessel, the lordships of Afferden, Arcen-Velden-Lomm, Walbeck-Twisteden, Raay and Klein-Kevelaer, Well, Bergen and Middelaar) into a new "Principality of Orange". <REPHRASE> The kings of Prussia and the German emperors styled themselves Princes of Orange till 1918. <DELETE> An agnatic relative of William III, John William Friso of Nassau, who was also cognatically descended from William the Silent, was designated the heir to the princes of Orange in the Netherlands by the last will of William III. <REPHRASE> Several of his descendants became stadtholders. <REPHRASE> They claim the principality of Orange on the basis of agnatic inheritance, similar to that of William the Silent, who had inherited Orange from his cousin René of Châlon. <DELETE> They did however have a claim, albeit distant, to the principality itself due to John William Friso's descent from Louise de Coligny, who was a descendant of the original Princes of Orange. <DELETE> (Louise's great grandmother, Anne Pot, Countess of St. Pol, was a descendant of Tiburge d'Orange, who married into the des Baux family) <DELETE> They also claimed on the basis of the testament of Philip William, Maurice and William III. <DELETE> Finally, they claimed on the basis that Orange was an independent state whose sovereign had the right to assign his succession according to his will. <DELETE> France never recognized any of this, nor allowed the Orange-Nassaus or the Hohenzollerns to obtain anything of the principality itself. <REPHRASE> The Oranje-Nassaus nevertheless assumed the title and also erected several of their lordships into a new principality of Orange. <SPLIT> From that derivation of the title comes the tradition of the house of Nassau-Dietz, the later stadtholders of the Netherlands, and the present-day royal family of the Netherlands, of holding this title. <REPHRASE> They maintain the tradition of William the Silent and the house of Orange-Nassau. <DELETE> Until 1340, it was customary for all sons of the prince of Orange to inherit the title. <REPHRASE> Only the direct line of descent to Raimond V is shown here. <REPHRASE> William of Nassau inherited the principality of Orange from his cousin René.

<REPHRASE> The River Dart is a river in Devon, England which rises high on Dartmoor, and releases to the sea at Dartmouth. <SPLIT> The river's name is presumed to be Brythonic Celtic meaning 'river where oak trees grow' due to the banks of the lower Dart being covered in ancient woods of native oak. <SPLIT> The Cornish word for oak is "derow"; alternatively the word for water is "dowr", the probable source of other British hydronyms such as Derwent Water. <REPHRASE> Bray notes in 1832 that the name was occasionally spelled 'Darant'. <SPLIT> The river begins as two separate branches (the East Dart and West Dart), which join at Dartmeet. <SPLIT> The paths along these rivers offer very attractive walking, and there are several small waterfalls. <DELETE> The rivers are crossed by a number of clapper bridges, notably at the hamlet of Postbridge. <REPHRASE> After leaving the moor, the Dart flows southwards past Buckfast Abbey and through the towns of Buckfastleigh, Dartington and Totnes. <SPLIT> At Totnes, where there is a seventeenth-century weir (rebuilt in the 1960s), it becomes tidal, and there are no bridges below the town. <REPHRASE> The Dart estuary is a large ria and is popular for sailing. <SPLIT> The village of Kingswear and town of Dartmouth are on the east and west sides of the estuary, and are linked by two vehicle ferries and a passenger ferry. <COPY> The Kingswear Regatta is held each year. <REPHRASE> The deep water port of Dartmouth is a sheltered haven. <REPHRASE> The entrance to the river from the sea is a rocky entrance with cliffs either side. <REPHRASE> On the East side Kingswear Castle sits very close to the water's edge, and on the west side Dartmouth Castle is built on a rocky promontory at sea level. <SPLIT> The castles once operated a defensive chain across the estuary, which was raised at dusk to destroy enemy ships attempting to attack the harbour. <REPHRASE> The remains of the operating mechanisms for the chain are still visible in Dartmouth castle. <DELETE> The flooded ria that forms the lower reaches of the Dart, with its deep water and steeply sloping valley sides, is a considerable barrier to crossing traffic. <COPY> There are no bridges below Totnes. <REPHRASE> The lower section of the River Dart forms Dartmouth Harbour, a deep water natural harbour with a long history of maritime usage. <SPLIT> In modern times, the port's commercial activity has declined, but it is still a busy port for local fishing vessels and a wide variety of yachts and other private boats. <REPHRASE> Several local companies specialise in shipbuilding and repairs to small tonnage craft.

<SPLIT> The Kow Swamp archaeological site comprises a series of late Pleistocene burials within the lunette of the eastern rim of a former lake known as Kow Swamp. <DELETE> The site is located 10 km south-east of Cohuna in the central Murray River valley, in northern Victoria, at . <SPLIT> The site is significant for archaeological excavations by Alan Thorne between 1968 and 1972 which recovered the partial skeletal remains of more than 22 individuals. <DELETE> The name of Kow Swamp is derived from an Aboriginal word in the Yorta Yorta language, "(Ghow)", which refers to the white gypsum soil found in the area. <SPLIT> Kow Swamp is now a permanent water body, due to its use for irrigation storage, 15 kilometres in circumference, with an average depth of 3 metres. <SPLIT> Originally a low lying swamp, it was filled when the Murray River is in flood or running at high levels, while Bendigo creek provides a smaller amount of water. <REPHRASE> There is evidence of recent Aboriginal occupation of the area from canoe trees and middens, while early settlers' records describe an Aboriginal ceremonial site on the north side of the swamp. <SPLIT> The most notable evidence was the discovery in 1925, on the west side of the swamp, of the Cohuna Cranium by a local earthmoving contractor. <REPHRASE> The editor of the local newspaper "Cohuna Farmers Weekly" notified authorities and the significance of the discovery was realised. <SPLIT> In the 1960s, Alan Thorne also identified archaic bone from the collection at the Museum of Victoria, and traced the find spot to Kow Swamp. <REPHRASE> Archaeological excavations were undertaken between 1968 and 1972 by Thorne for the Australian National University in Canberra. <REPHRASE> Further remains were found around the swamp by an interested local resident, Gordon Spark. <REPHRASE> By 1972 the remains of at least forty individuals had been excavated and studied. <REPHRASE> These discoveries helped establish the diversity of Aboriginal genetic history and have been interpreted as representing different waves of immigrants to Australia before European discovery. <REPHRASE> Radiocarbon dates returned a wide range of ages for the burials, with 13,000 ± 280 (ANU1236) from shell in the grave of KS5 and 10,070 ± 250 (ANU-403b), from bone apatite from KS10 respectively. <REPHRASE> The youngest date was approximately 6500 BP for KS1. <REPHRASE> Optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating was undertaken of the Kow Swamp burial site in 2003 (close to KS 9, the only burial excavated in situ), which suggested that the cemetery was in use between 22 and 19 ka, rather than 15 – 9 ka. <REPHRASE> Some question the OSL dates due to the difficulty of ensuring that the dated sand is contemporary with the actual burials. <DELETE> However, the OSL dates from the burial units directly contradict the C14 dates, which were only ever minimum ages because of contamination by younger carbon. <REPHRASE> The initial descriptions of the crania from Kow Swamp identified "receding frontal squama, massive supraorbital regions and a supraglabella fossae..." which were considered to be "preserving an almost unmodified eastern erectus form" displaying a ".. <DELETE> complex of archaic characteristics not seen in recent Aboriginal crania...". <REPHRASE> The features were considered to indicate "the survival of "Homo erectus" features in Australia until as recently as 10,000 years ago". <SPLIT> However, Donald Brothwell disputed this interpretation suggesting the vault size and shape at Kow Swamp had been influenced by artificial cranial deformation, particularly in Kow Swamp 5. <SPLIT> The varying morphological and metrical comparisons of the burials have distinguished them from modern Aboriginal crania and also a more gracile group of Pleistocene remains found at Lake Mungo and Keilor. <DELETE> These differences have been used to postulate separate arrivals of distinct groups of people. <REPHRASE> However, more recent comparison does not support Thorne's dual Pleistocene population model. <SPLIT> Following a campaign by Aboriginal community groups to have human remains repatriated from Australian and overseas museum collections, the Kow Swamp skeletons were returned to the area and re-interred. <DELETE> Casts of some of the Kow Swamp crania and mandibles are held by the Archaeology and Human Sciences department at the Australian National University, with some casts (including casts of KS1 and 5) being sent to the London Natural History Museum and other institutions. <REPHRASE> Despite extensive reconstruction, the Kow Swamp material was extremely fragmentary, with only two of the crania, KS1 and 5, being relatively complete.

<DELETE> On Wikipedia, trusted users may be appointed as administrators (also known as admins, sysops, and janitors), following a successful request for adminship. <DELETE> As of 2019, there are administrators on the English Wikipedia. <DELETE> Administrators have additional technical privileges compared with other editors. <DELETE> On Wikipedia, becoming an admin is often referred to as being "given or taking up the mop", a term which has also been used elsewhere. <REPHRASE> In 2006, "The New York Times" reported that administrators on Wikipedia, of whom there were then about 1,000, were "geographically diverse". <SPLIT> In July 2012, it was widely reported that Wikipedia was "running out of administrators", because in 2005 and 2006, 40 to 50 people were often appointed administrators each month, but in the first half of 2012, only nine in total were appointed. <SPLIT> However, Jimmy Wales, Wikipedia's co-founder, denied that this was a crisis or that Wikipedia was running out of admins, saying, "The number of admins has been stable for about two years, there's really nothing going on." <DELETE> Wales had previously (in a message sent to the English Wikipedia mailing list on February 11, 2003) stated that being an admin is "not a big deal", and that "It's merely a technical matter that the powers given to sysops are not given out to everyone." <SPLIT> In his book "Wikipedia – The Missing Manual", John Broughton states that while many people think of administrators on Wikipedia as judges, that is not the purpose of the role. <REPHRASE> Instead, he says, admins usually "delete pages" and "protect pages involved in edit wars". <SPLIT> While the first Wikipedia administrators were appointed by Jimmy Wales in October 2001, administrator privileges on Wikipedia are now granted through a process known as requests for adminship (RfA). <DELETE> Any registered editor may nominate themselves, or may request another editor to do so. <REPHRASE> The process has been said to be "akin to putting someone through the Supreme Court" by Andrew Lih, a scientist and professor who is himself an administrator on the English Wikipedia. <SPLIT> Lih also said, "It's pretty much a hazing ritual at this point", in contrast to how the process worked early in Wikipedia's history, when all one had to do to become an admin was "prove you weren't a bozo". <DELETE> Candidacy for the role is normally considered only after "extensive work on the wiki". <SPLIT> While any editor may vote in an RfA, the outcome is not determined by a majority vote, but rather by whether or not consensus has been reached that the candidate would make a good administrator, a decision which can only be made by a bureaucrat, a Wikipedia editor who is also appointed by the community through a "request" process, though the process is much stricter for them than for administrators. <DELETE> This may have been implemented as a result of RfAs attracting increasing levels of attention: Stvilia et al. quoted that "Prior to mid-2005, RfAs typically did not attract much attention. <DELETE> Since then, it has become quite common for RfAs to attract huge numbers of RfA groupies who all support one another". <REPHRASE> Once granted administrator privileges, a user has access to additional functions in order to perform certain duties. <SPLIT> These include "messy cleanup work", deletion of articles deemed unsuitable, protecting pages (restricting editing privileges to that page), and blocking the accounts of disruptive users. <SPLIT> Blocking a user must be done according to Wikipedia's policies and a reason must be stated for the block, which will be permanently logged by the software. <DELETE> Use of this privilege to "gain editing advantages" is considered inappropriate. <REPHRASE> A scientific paper by researchers from Virginia Tech and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute found that after editors are promoted to administrator status, they often focus more on articles about controversial topics than they did before. <REPHRASE> The researchers also proposed an alternative method for choosing administrators, in which more weight is given to the votes of experienced editors. <DELETE> Another paper, presented at the 2008 Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, analyzed data from all 1,551 requests for adminship from January 2006 to October 2007, with the goal of determining which (if any) of the criteria recommended in Wikipedia's "Guide to requests for adminship" page were the best predictors of whether the user in question would actually become an admin. <DELETE> In December 2013, a similar study was published by researchers from the Polish-Japanese Institute of Information Technology in Warsaw which aimed to model the results of requests for adminship on the Polish Wikipedia using a model derived from Wikipedia's edit history. <DELETE> They found that they could "classify the votes in the RfA procedures using this model with an accuracy level that should be sufficient to recommend candidates."

Zamenhof, was a Polish ophthalmologist and the inventor of the international language Esperanto, the most widely-used constructed international auxiliary language in the world. <SPLIT> Zamenhof was born on 15 December O.S. 3 December 1859 , the son of Markus Zamenhof (27 January O.S. 15 January 1837 - 29 November O.S. 16 November 1907 ) and Rozalia Zamenhof (1839 - 1 September O.S. 20 August 1892 ), in the multi-ethnic city of Belostok in Russian Empire (now Białystok in Poland). <DELETE> At that time the city was in the Grodno Governorate of the Russian Empire as a result of the 1807 Treaties of Tilsit. <REPHRASE> His parents were of Litvak Jewish descent. <REPHRASE> This group inhabited the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania. <REPHRASE> He appears to have been natively bilingual in Yiddish and Russian. <REPHRASE> His father was a teacher of German and French. <COPY> From him, Zamenhof learned German, French and Hebrew. <COPY> He also spoke some major language of Białystok: Polish, a Yiddish, Belarusian, and German. <REPHRASE> Polish became the native language of his children in Warsaw. <REPHRASE> In school he studied the classical languages Latin, Greek, Hebrew, and Aramaic. <REPHRASE> He later learned some English, though in his own words not very well. <REPHRASE> He had an interest in Lithuanian and Italian, and learned Volapük when it came out in 1880. <REPHRASE> By that point his international language project was already well developed. <REPHRASE> As a student at secondary school in Warsaw, Zamenhof attempted to create an international language with a grammar that was rich, but complex. <REPHRASE> When he later studied English, he decided that the international language must have a simpler grammar. <REPHRASE> Apart from his parents' native languages Russian and Yiddish and his adopted language Polish, his projects were also aided by his mastery of German, a good passive understanding of Latin, Hebrew and French, and a basic knowledge of Greek, English and Italian. <COPY> Zamenhof's grandson, Louis-Christophe Zaleski-Zamenhof (Adam's son), has lived in France since the 1960s. <COPY> Zamenhof was nominated 12 times for the Nobel Peace Prize.
<REPHRASE> S/2004 S 6 is the provisional designation of a dusty object seen orbiting Saturn very close to the F ring. <REPHRASE> It is not clear whether it is only a transient clump of dust, or if there is a solid moonlet at its core. <SPLIT> It was first seen by scientists in images taken by the Cassini-Huygens probe on October 28, 2004 and announced on November 8 that year. <SPLIT> It appears to be the best tracked object in this region with at least five probable sightings in the period to late 2005. <REPHRASE> In comparison, two objects in the F ring's vicinity (S/2004 S 3 and S/2004 S 4 ) that were first seen several months earlier have not been recovered with any confidence. <SPLIT> Nevertheless, it continues to be unclear whether there is a solid core to S/2004 S 6 or whether it is just a transient dust clump that will dissipate on a timescale of years or months. <SPLIT> Notably, an imaging sequence covering an entire orbital period at 4 km resolution taken on November 15, 2004 (soon after S/2004 S 6 's discovery) failed to recover the object, while it has been seen again later. <REPHRASE> The lighting conditions in S/2004 S 6 's part of the orbit were different during these two observations, however, with the discovery being made when the region was strongly backlit by the sun. <SPLIT> A suggested resolution of the absence in November is that S/2004 S 6 's visibility is primarily due to a diffuse cloud of fine dust that is much brighter in forward scattered light (the conditions of the discovery image), and that the solid core (if any) is small. <SPLIT> S/2004 S 6 has been seen both inside and outside the main F ring, and its orbit must cross the ring. <SPLIT> Careful calculations show that the object periodically plows through the ring material, coming within 1.5 km of the densest core e.g. on 9 April 2005. <SPLIT> It has been suggested that a spiral structure in the tenuous material surrounding the F ring may have been a consequence of this. <REPHRASE> The dusty halo seen in images is sizeable, being around 2000 km in lengthwise extent. <REPHRASE> The solid object, if any, would be no greater than 3–5 km in diameter based on brightness.
<SPLIT> Lake Mweru (also spelled "Mwelu", "Mwero") is a freshwater lake on the longest arm of Africa's second-longest river, the Congo. <DELETE> Located on the border between Zambia and Democratic Republic of the Congo, it makes up 110 km of the total length of the Congo, lying between its Luapula River (upstream) and Luvua River (downstream) segments. <SPLIT> Mweru means 'lake' in a number of Bantu languages, so it is often referred to as just 'Mweru'. <REPHRASE> The move of the boma from Chiengi to Kalungwishi had the effect of leaving the Belgian boma at Pweto a free rein at the northern end of the lake, leading a hundred years later to about 33 km2 of Zambian territory next to Pweto being ceded to the DR Congo (then Zaire). <DELETE> See the Luapula Province border dispute for further details and references.

<REPHRASE> 70 Virginis b (abbreviated 70 Vir b) is an extrasolar planet approximately 60 light-years away in the constellation of Virgo. <SPLIT> Announced in 1996 by Geoffrey Marcy and R. Paul Butler, 70 Virginis was one of the first stars confirmed to have planets orbiting it. <SPLIT> When first announced, 70 Virginis b was considered to be within its star's habitable zone (preferably in the "Goldilocks zone"), but it was later confirmed that the planet has an eccentric orbit, closer to its parent. <REPHRASE> 70 Virginis b is a gas giant extrasolar planet that is 7.5 times the mass of Jupiter and is in an eccentric 116-day orbit about its host. <REPHRASE> Its surface gravity is expected to be about six to eight times that of Jupiter's. <SPLIT> At the time of discovery in January 1996, it was believed that the star was only 29 ly away resulting in the star being less luminous based on its apparent magnitude. <SPLIT> As a result, the planet's orbit was thought to be in the habitable zone and the planet was nicknamed Goldilocks (not too cold or too hot). <REPHRASE> The Hipparcos satellite later showed that the star was more distant from Earth and therefore brighter resulting in the planet being too hot to be in the habitable zone.

<SPLIT> An amicus curiae (literally, "friend of the court"; plural, amici curiae) is someone who is not a party to a case and may or may not have been solicited by a party and who assists a court by offering information, expertise, or insight that has a bearing on the issues in the case; and is typically presented in the form of a brief. <DELETE> The decision on whether to consider an amicus brief lies within the discretion of the court. <REPHRASE> The phrase "amicus curiae" is legal Latin. <REPHRASE> The "amicus curiae" figure originates in Roman law. <DELETE> Starting in the 9th century, it was incorporated into English law, and it was later extended to most common law systems. <COPY> Later, it was introduced in international law, in particular concerning human rights. <REPHRASE> From there, it was integrated in some civil law systems (it has recently been integrated into Argentina's law system and Honduras's 2010 civil procedures code). <REPHRASE> Today, it is used by the European Court of Human Rights, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, the Court of Justice of the European Union and the Special Tribunal for Lebanon. <DELETE> The situation most often noted in the press is when an advocacy group files a brief in a case before an appellate court in which it is not a litigant. <DELETE> Appellate cases are normally limited to the factual record and arguments coming from the lower court case under appeal; attorneys focus on the facts and arguments most favorable to their clients. <DELETE> Where a case may have broader implications, "amicus curiae" briefs are a way to articulate those concerns, so that the possibly broad legal or public policy ramifications of the court's anticipated decisions will not depend solely on the positions and arguments advanced by the parties directly involved in the case. <DELETE> In prominent cases, "amici curiae" are generally organizations with sizable legal budgets. <DELETE> In the United States, for example, non-profit legal advocacy organizations, such as the American Civil Liberties Union, the Landmark Legal Foundation, the Pacific Legal Foundation, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the American Center for Law and Justice or NORML, frequently submit such briefs to advocate for or against a particular legal change or interpretation. <REPHRASE> If a decision could affect an entire industry, companies other than the litigants may wish to have their concerns heard. <REPHRASE> In the United States, federal courts often hear cases involving the constitutionality of state laws. <DELETE> Hence states may file briefs as "amici curiae" when their laws or interests are likely to be affected, as in the Supreme Court case "McDonald v. Chicago," when thirty-two states under the aegis of Texas (and California independently) filed such briefs. <DELETE> "Amici curiae" who do not file briefs often present an academic perspective on the case. <DELETE> For example, if the law gives deference to a history of legislation of a certain topic, a historian may choose to evaluate the claim from specialized expertise. <REPHRASE> An economist, statistician, or sociologist may choose to do the same. <DELETE> Newspaper editorials, blogs, and other opinion pieces arguably have the capability to influence Supreme Court decisions as "de facto amici curiae". <SPLIT> They are not, however, technically considered "amicus curiae," as they do not submit materials to the Court, do not need to ask for leave, and have no guarantee that they will be read. <DELETE> The Supreme Court of the United States has special rules for "amicus curiae" briefs sought to be filed in cases pending before it. <DELETE> Supreme Court Rule 37 states, in part, such a brief should cover "relevant matter" not dealt with by the parties which "may be of considerable help". <DELETE> The cover of an "amicus" brief must identify which party the brief is supporting, or if the brief supports only affirmance or reversal. <DELETE> The Court also requires that, "inter alia", all non-governmental amici identify those providing a monetary contribution to the preparation or submission of the brief. <SPLIT> Briefs must be prepared in booklet format, and 40 copies must be served with the Court. <DELETE> In the United States Supreme Court, unless the "amicus" brief is being filed by the federal government (or one of its officers or agents) or a U.S. state, permission of the court (by means of motion for leave) or mutual consent of the parties is generally required. <DELETE> Allowing an "amicus curiae" to present oral argument is considered "extraordinary". <SPLIT> The court can also appoint its own "amicus curiae" if neither party supports the decision of the lower court, which it has done at least 44 times. <DELETE> The role of "amicus curiae" briefs in the World Trade Organization (WTO) dispute settlement system is controversial. <REPHRASE> The controversy arises due to the governmental nature of WTO disputes. <DELETE> As only WTO members have access to the system, any non-members such as non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are excluded and have no right to be heard. <DELETE> Thus the only way for them to contribute to a WTO decision is through "amicus curiae" briefs. <DELETE> To date there is a divergence in approaches in the WTO as to the admissibility of such briefs.

<SPLIT> A Philosopher Lecturing on the Orrery, or the full title, A Philosopher giving a Lecture on the Orrery in which a lamp is put in place of the Sun, is a 1766 painting by Joseph Wright of Derby depicting a lecturer giving a demonstration of an orrery to a small audience. <DELETE> It is now in the Derby Museum and Art Gallery The painting preceded his similar "An Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump" (National Gallery, London). <REPHRASE> In both of these works, the candlelit setting had a realist justification. <SPLIT> Viewing sculpture by candlelight, when the contours showed well, and there might even be an impression of movement from the flickering light, was a fashionable practice described by Goethe. <REPHRASE> In the orrery demonstration the shadows cast by the lamp representing the Sun were an essential part of the display. <SPLIT> But there seems no reason other than heightened drama to stage the air pump experiment in a room lit by a single candle, and in two later paintings of the subject by Charles-Amédée-Philippe van Loo the lighting is normal. <DELETE> An anonymous review from the time called Wright "a very great and uncommon genius in a peculiar way". <SPLIT> "The Orrery" was painted without a commission, probably in the expectation that it would be bought by Washington Shirley, 5th Earl Ferrers, an amateur astronomer who had an orrery of his own, and with whom Wright's friend Peter Perez Burdett was staying while in Derbyshire. <SPLIT> Figures thought to be portraits of Burdett and Ferrers feature in the painting, Burdett taking notes and Ferrers seated with a youth next to the orrery. <SPLIT> Ferrers purchased the painting, which was exhibited in 1766, for £210, but the 6th Earl auctioned it off, and it is now in the Derby Museum and Art Gallery, where it is on permanent display, close to a working replica of a full-sized mechanical Grand Orrery. <DELETE> A biographer of Wright, Benedict Nicolson, argued in 1968 that John Whitehurst was the model for the lecturer, while another commentator points out the figure's resemblance to "a painting of Isaac Newton by Godfrey Kneller". <SPLIT> Close observation of the adult faces in the picture reveals that each one demonstrates one or other of the main phases of the Moon – new moon, half moon, gibbous moon and full moon.

<REPHRASE> The royal titulary or royal protocol is the standard naming convention taken by the pharaohs of ancient Egypt. <REPHRASE> It symbolises worldly power and holy might and also acts as a sort of mission statement for the reign of a monarch (sometimes it even changed during the reign). <SPLIT> The full titulary, consisting of five names, did not come into standard usage until the Middle Kingdom but remained in use as late as the Roman Empire. <REPHRASE> G5-O33 The Horus name is the oldest form of the pharaoh's name, originating in prehistoric Egypt. <REPHRASE> Many of the oldest-known Egyptian pharaohs were known only by this title. <REPHRASE> The Horus name was usually written in a serekh, a representation of a palace façade. <REPHRASE> The name of the pharaoh was written in hieroglyphs inside this representation of a palace. <COPY> Typically an image of the falcon god Horus was perched on top of or beside it. <SPLIT> At least one Egyptian ruler, the Second Dynasty pharoah Seth-Peribsen, used an image of the god Set instead of Horus, perhaps signifying an internal religious division within the country. <SPLIT> He was succeeded by Khasekhemwy, who placed the symbols of both Set and Horus above his name. <REPHRASE> Thereafter, the image of Horus always appeared alongside the name of the pharaoh. <REPHRASE> By the time of the New Kingdom, the Horus name was often written without the enclosing serekh. <DELETE> The name is first definitively used by the First Dynasty pharaoh Semerkhet, though it only became a fully independent title by the Twelfth Dynasty. <SPLIT> This particular name was not typically framed by a cartouche or serekh, but always begins with the hieroglyphs of a vulture and cobra resting upon two baskets, the dual noun "nebty". <SPLIT> G8 Also known as the "Golden Horus Name", this form of the pharaoh's name typically featured the image of a Horus falcon perched above or beside the hieroglyph for gold. <REPHRASE> The meaning of this particular title has been disputed. <SPLIT> One belief is that it represents the triumph of Horus over his uncle Seth, as the symbol for gold can be taken to mean that Horus was "superior to his foes". <SPLIT> Gold also was strongly associated in the ancient Egyptian mind with eternity, so this may have been intended to convey the pharaoh's eternal Horus name. <REPHRASE> Similar to the Nebty name, this particular name typically was not framed by a cartouche or serekh. <SPLIT> M23:t-L2:t The pharaoh's throne name, the first of the two names written inside a cartouche, and usually accompanied the title "nsw-bity" ("nsw(t)-bjt(j)"), traditionally interpreted as "He of sedge and bee" and often translated for convenience as "King of Upper and of Lower Egypt", with the sedge and bee being symbols for Upper and Lower Egypt, respectively, although recent research has thrown this interpretation into doubt. <REPHRASE> The epithet "nb tꜣwy", "Lord of the Two Lands", referring to valley and delta regions of Egypt, often occurs as well. <COPY> - This was the name given at birth. <DELETE> The name itself was preceded by the title "Son of Ra", written with the hieroglyph of a duck ("za"), a homonym for the word meaning "son" ("za"), adjacent to an image of the sun, a hieroglyph for the chief solar deity Ra. <SPLIT> It was first introduced to the set of royal titles in the Fourth Dynasty and emphasizes the king's role as a representative of the solar god Ra. <REPHRASE> For women who became pharaoh, the preceding title was interpreted as "daughter" also. <DELETE> Modern historians typically refer to the ancient kings of Egypt by this name, adding ordinals (e.g. "II", "III") to distinguish between different individuals bearing the same name.
