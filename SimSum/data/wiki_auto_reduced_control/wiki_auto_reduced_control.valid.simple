'Tropical Storm Beryl was the third tropical storm of the 2006 Atlantic hurricane season.' 'Developing from a tropical disturbance on July 18, it tracked generally northward, and strengthened to attain peak winds of 60 mph (95 km/h) under generally favorable conditions.' 'After turning to the northeast, Beryl weakened over cooler waters.' 'On July 21 it struck the island of Nantucket, and shortly thereafter it became extratropical.' 'The extratropical remnants continued northeastward through Nova Scotia, and on July 22 it merged with an approaching cold front.' 'Beryl produced rough seas along the northeast United States coastline.' 'In Massachusetts, its impact was limited to light rainfall and gusty winds, with no reported damage.' 'Beryl later produced moderate rainfall and gusty winds across Atlantic Canada, resulting in some localized power outages though little damage.' 'No deaths were reported.' 'A cold front moved off the East Coast of the United States on July 16 and stalled off the coast of North Carolina.' 'It slowly decayed into a surface low pressure trough, and developed into two disturbances; one was centered 290 miles (490 km) south-southeast of Cape Cod and another was located 200 miles (320 km) south of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina.' 'The first low quickly organized into an unnamed tropical storm, and the other area stayed broad and disorganized.' 'However, by July 18, the system became much better organized with improved banding features, and the area developed into Tropical Depression Two while located 220 miles (355 km) south-southeast of Cape Hatteras.' 'The depression moved slowly to the north-northwest through a break in the subtropical ridge, and as convective banding features became more visible the system strengthened into Tropical Storm Beryl.' 'Throughout much of its duration, the storm tracked through an environment with light vertical wind shear and well-established upper-level outflow.' 'Shortly after becoming a tropical storm, the low-level circulation of Beryl became exposed with limited deep convection, though deep convection re-developed the following morning.' 'Outflow continued to improve, and with warm sea surface temperatures Beryl slowly strengthened further to reach peak winds of 60 mph (95 km/h) early on July 20 while located about 120 miles (190 km) east of Nags Head, North Carolina.' 'Beryl maintained peak winds for about 18 hours as it paralleled the Mid-Atlantic and New Jersey coasts, during which an eye-like feature developed in the center of the convection.' 'Late on July 20, it began a slow weakening trend after passing over cooler waters.' 'Steering winds ahead of an approaching mid-level trough caused Beryl to speed up northeastward, and early on July 21 the center of the storm crossed the island of Nantucket.' 'The convection diminished as it moved through progressively colder waters, and shortly after 1200 UTC on July 21 Beryl became an extratropical cyclone a short distance east of Cape Cod.' 'Hours later, it made landfall in southwestern Nova Scotia, and on July 22 the extratropical remnants of Beryl merged with an approaching cold front over Newfoundland.' 'Forecasters originally predicted Beryl to brush the Carolinas; as such, a tropical storm watch was issued for the eastern coast of North Carolina from Cape Lookout northward to Currituck Beach Lighthouse.' "When a more northeastward track became apparent, a tropical storm watch was issued about 33 hours before moving ashore from Woods Hole to Plymouth, Massachusetts, including Cape Cod, Nantucket, and Martha's Vineyard." 'About 22 hours before landfall, the National Hurricane Center replaced the watch with a tropical storm warning for the same area, and also issued a tropical storm watch from Woods Hole, Massachusetts westward to New Haven, Connecticut and for the eastern portion of Long Island from east of Fire Island to Port Jefferson.' 'Expecting for the storm, the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency was activated as a trial run for the hurricane season.' 'Local Red Cross chapters were opened, as well, with two volunteer teams placed on standby to assist.' 'Across southeastern Massachusetts, police departments maintained extra staff in preparation for any potential problems from the storm.' 'Many fishermen secured their boats, while some business owners boarded up windows to prevent storm damage.' 'Several days prior to the passage of Beryl through Atlantic Canada, the Canadian Hurricane Centre issued gale warnings for the coastal waters off of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland.' 'In anticipation of heavy rainfall, the agency also issued heavy rainfall warnings for western Nova Scotia, including Halifax.' 'The storm caused high waves along the East Coast of the United States, with 19 foot seas (5.97 m) in the open ocean.' 'Waves along the southern coast of Nantucket reached 10 feet in height as the storm approached the island, resulting in four people being rescued by lifeguards from rip currents.' 'High surf was also reported along the southern coast of Massachusetts and Rhode Island.' 'Beryl also produced a storm surge of 0.9 feet on Nantucket.' 'Winds across southeastern Massachusetts were fairly light, with no sustained tropical storm force winds and wind gusts peaking at 44 mph; unofficially gusts reached 51 mph.' 'Beryl dropped moderate precipitation just offshore, though the maximum precipitation total in the United States was only 0.97 inches (24.6 mm) on Nantucket.' 'Rainfall along southeastern Massachusetts reached 0.33 inches at Chatham.' 'The only reported damage were some downed telephone poles and fallen tree branches.' 'Overall impact was minor; there were no reported power outages, deaths, injuries, or maritime emergencies in association with the storm.' 'The remnants of Beryl dropped moderate precipitation in Atlantic Canada, officially peaking at 2.8 inches (71 mm) in Scotts Bay, Nova Scotia with an unofficially higher total of 3.5 inches (88 mm); in some locations 1 inch of rain fell in an hour.' 'Additionally, a station in Fredericton, New Brunswick reported 1.77 inches (45 mm) in 2 hours.' 'The rainfall caused some flooding, with some overflown streams flooding some streets.'

'They are also known as admins, sysops, and janitors.', 'Administrator are appointed following a successful request for adminship.' 'As of 2019, there are administrators on the Simple English Wikipedia.' 'Administrators have special rights that other editors do not have.' 'On Wikipedia, becoming an admin is often referred to as being "given or taking up the mop", a term which has also been used elsewhere.' 'In 2006,there were about 1,000 administrators on the English Wikipedia.' 'In July 2012, it was reported that Wikipedia was "running out of administrators".', 'This was because in 2006-2007 an average of 40-50 new administrators were appointed.', 'In the first six months of 2012 only 9 new administrators were appointed.'

'Any editor can vote in an RfA.', 'The decision if a consensus has been reached can only be made by a bureaucrat.', 'A bureaucrat is a Wikipedia editor who is also appointed by the community through a "request" process which is much stricter for them than for administrators.'

'But then RfAs started attracting groups of editors who all supported one another.'   "When an admin blocks a user they must do so according to Wikipedia's policies.", 'One of the policies is that a reason must be given for the block.', 'The reason for the block is permanently logged by the software.'  'A scientific paper by researchers from Virginia Tech and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute found that after editors are promoted to administrator status, they often focus more on articles about controversial topics than they did before.' 'The researchers also proposed an alternative method for choosing administrators, in which more weight is given to the votes of experienced editors.' 'Another paper, presented at the 2008 Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, analyzed data from all 1,551 requests for adminship from January 2006 to October 2007 to find out which (if any) of the criteria recommended in Wikipedia\'s "Guide to requests for adminship" page were the best predictors of whether the user in question would actually become an admin.' "In December 2013, a similar study was published by researchers from the Polish-Japanese Institute of Information Technology in Warsaw which aimed to model the results of requests for adminship on the Polish Wikipedia using a model derived from Wikipedia's edit history." 'They found that they could "classify the votes in the RfA procedures using this model with an accuracy level that should be sufficient to recommend candidates."'

'S/2004 S 6 is the designation of a dusty object seen orbiting Saturn very close to the F ring.' 'It is not clear whether it is only a clump of dust, or if there is a solid small moon at its core.' 'It was first seen by scientists in pictures taken by the Cassini-Huygens probe on October 28, 2004, and announced on 8 November that year.' 'It appears to be the best tracked object in this area with at least five possible sightings in the period till late 2005.' "In comparison, two objects in the F ring's area (S/2004 S 3 and S/2004 S 4) that were first seen months earlier have not been found again with any confidence." 'Nevertheless, it continues to be unclear whether there is a solid core to S/2004 S 6 or whether it is just a dust clump that will disappear in years or months.' "Notably, an imaging sequence covering an entire orbital period at 4 km resolution taken on 15 November, 2004 (soon after S/2004 S 6's discovery) failed to find the object, while it has been seen again later." "The lighting conditions in S/2004 S 6's part of the orbit were different during these two sightings, however, with the discovery being made when the area was strongly backlit by the sun." "A suggested resolution of the absence in November is that S/2004 S 6's visibility is primarily due to a diffuse cloud of fine dust that is much brighter in forward scattered light (the conditions of the discovery image), and that the solid core (if any) is small." 'S/2004 S 6 has been seen both inside and outside the main F ring, and its orbit must cross the ring.' 'Careful calculations show that the object periodically plows through the ring material, coming within 1.5 km of the densest core e.g. on 9 April, 2005.' 'It has been suggested that a spiral structure in the thinnest material around the F ring may have been a result of this.' 'The dusty halo seen in pictures is big, being around 2000 km in lengthwise extent.' 'The solid object, if any, would be no bigger than 3−5 km in diameter based on brightness.'

'The adult females usually lay eggs near the nests of possible hosts, often in the burrows of solitary bees, wasps or beetles.' 'Although most bee-flies usually are fairly or highly host-specific, some species do attack a number of hosts.'

"Its surface gravity is thought to be about two to three times that of Jupiter's."

'An amicus curiae (literally, friend of the court; plural, amici curiae) is someone who is not a party to a case and offers information that affects the case but who has not been asked by any of the parties to assist a court.' 'The decision on whether to admit the information lies at the discretion of the court.' 'The phrase "amicus curiae" is legal Latin.' 'The "amicus curiae" practice was found in Roman law.'  'Later, it was introduced in international law, in particular, concerning human rights.'  'Today, it is used by the European Court of Human Rights.', 'It is also used in the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, the Court of Justice of the European Union and the Special Tribunal for Lebanon.' 'The situation most often noted in the press is when an advocacy group files a brief in a case before an appellate court to which it is not a litigant.' 'Appellate cases are normally limited to the factual record and arguments coming from the lower court case under appeal.', 'Usually attorneys focus on the facts and arguments most favorable to their clients.' 'Where a case may have broader implications, "amicus curiae" briefs are a way to introduce those concerns, so that the possibly broad legal effects of court decisions will not depend solely on the parties directly involved in the case.' 'In prominent cases, "amici curiae" are generally organizations with sizable legal budgets.' 'In the United States, for example, non-profit legal advocacy organizations, such as the American Civil Liberties Union, the Landmark Legal Foundation, the Pacific Legal Foundation, and others, frequently submit such briefs to advocate for or against a particular legal change or interpretation.' 'If a decision could affect an entire industry, companies other than the litigants may wish to have their concerns heard.' 'In the United States, federal courts often hear cases involving the constitutionality of state laws.' 'Hence states may file briefs as "amici curiae" when their laws are likely to be affected, as in the Supreme Court case "McDonald v. Chicago," when thirty-two states under the aegis of Texas (and California independently) filed such briefs.' '"Amici curiae" who do not file briefs often present an academic perspective on the case.'   'Newspaper editorials, blogs, and other opinion pieces arguably have the capability to influence Supreme Court decisions as "de facto amici curiae".' 'They are not, however, technically considered "amicus curiae," as they do not submit materials to the Court, do not need to ask for leave, and have no guarantee that they will be read.' 'The Supreme Court of the United States has special rules for "amicus curiae" briefs sought to be filed in cases pending before it.' 'Supreme Court Rule 37 states, in part, such a brief should cover "relevant matter" not dealt with by the parties which "may be of considerable help".' 'The cover of an "amicus" brief must identify which party the brief is supporting, or if the brief supports only affirmance or reversal.' 'The Court also requires that, "inter alia", all non-governmental amici identify those providing a monetary contribution to the preparation or submission of the brief.' 'Briefs must be prepared in booklet format, and 40 copies must be served with the Court.' 'In the United States Supreme Court, unless the "amicus" brief is being filed by the federal government (or one of its officers or agents) or a U.S. state, permission of the court (by means of motion for leave) or mutual consent of the parties is generally required.' 'Allowing an "amicus curiae" to present oral argument is considered "extraordinary".'  'The role of "amicus curiae" briefs in the World Trade Organization (WTO) dispute settlement system is controversial.' 'The controversy arises due to the governmental nature of WTO disputes.' 'As only WTO members have access to the system, any non-members such as non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are excluded and have no right to be heard.'
