August Kekulé,88087,"Friedrich August Kekulé, later Friedrich August Kekule von Stradonitz ( ; ] ; 7 September 1829 – 13 July 1896), was a German organic chemist. <s> From the 1850s until his death, Kekulé was one of the most prominent chemists in Europe, especially in theoretical chemistry. <s> He was the principal founder of the theory of chemical structure. <s> The son of a civil servant, Kekulé was born in Darmstadt, the capital of the Grand Duchy of Hesse. <s> After graduating from secondary school (the Grand Ducal Gymnasium in Darmstadt), in the fall of 1847 he entered the University of Giessen, with the intention of studying architecture. <s> After hearing the lectures of Justus von Liebig in his first semester, he decided to study chemistry. <s> Following four years of study in Giessen and a brief compulsory military service, he took temporary assistantships in Paris (1851–52), in Chur, Switzerland (1852–53), and in London (1853–55), where he was decisively influenced by Alexander Williamson. <s> His Giessen doctoral degree was awarded in the summer of 1852. <s> In 1856 Kekulé became Privatdozent at the University of Heidelberg. <s> In 1858 he was hired as full professor at the University of Ghent, then in 1867 he was called to Bonn, where he remained for the rest of his career. <s> Basing his ideas on those of predecessors such as Williamson, Edward Frankland, William Odling, Auguste Laurent, Charles-Adolphe Wurtz and others, Kekulé was the principal formulator of the theory of chemical structure (1857–58). <s> This theory proceeds from the idea of atomic valence, especially the tetravalence of carbon (which Kekulé announced late in 1857) and the ability of carbon atoms to link to each other (announced in a paper published in May 1858), to the determination of the bonding order of all of the atoms in a molecule. <s> Archibald Scott Couper independently arrived at the idea of self-linking of carbon atoms (his paper appeared in June 1858), and provided the first molecular formulas where lines symbolize bonds connecting the atoms. <s> For organic chemists, the theory of structure provided dramatic new clarity of understanding, and a reliable guide to both analytic and especially synthetic work. <s> As a consequence, the field of organic chemistry developed explosively from this point. <s> Among those who were most active in pursuing early structural investigations were, in addition to Kekulé and Couper, Frankland, Wurtz, Alexander Crum Brown, Emil Erlenmeyer, and Alexander Butlerov. <s> Kekulé's most famous work was on the structure of benzene. <s> In 1865 Kekulé published a paper in French (for he was then still in Belgium) suggesting that the structure contained a six-membered ring of carbon atoms with alternating single and double bonds. <s> The following year he published a much longer paper in German on the same subject. <s> The empirical formula for benzene had been long known, but its highly unsaturated structure was a challenge to determine. <s> Archibald Scott Couper in 1858 and Joseph Loschmidt in 1861 suggested possible structures that contained multiple double bonds or multiple rings, but the study of aromatic compounds was in its earliest years, and too little evidence was then available to help chemists decide on any particular structure.","Friedrich August Kekule von

Quantifier (logic),65474,"In logic, quantification specifies the quantity of specimens in the domain of discourse that satisfy an open formula. <s> The two most common quantifiers mean ""for all"" and ""there exists"". <s> For example, in arithmetic, quantifiers allow one to say that the natural numbers go on forever, by writing that ""for all"" n (where n is a natural number), there is another number (say, the successor of n) which is one bigger than n. <s> Two fundamental kinds of quantification in predicate logic are universal quantification and existential quantification. <s> The traditional symbol for the universal quantifier ""all"" is ""∀"", a rotated letter ""A"", and for the existential quantifier ""exists"" is ""∃"", a rotated letter ""E"". <s> These quantifiers have been generalized beginning with the work of Mostowski and Lindström. <s> Quantification is used as well in natural languages; examples of quantifiers in English are ""for all"", ""for some"", ""many"", ""few"", ""a lot"", and ""no;"" see Quantifier (linguistics) for details. <s> Consider the following statement: This has the appearance of an ""infinite conjunction"" of propositions. <s> From the point of view of formal languages this is immediately a problem, since syntax rules are expected to generate finite words. <s> The two most common quantifiers are the universal quantifier and the existential quantifier. <s> The traditional symbol for the universal quantifier is ""∀"", a rotated letter ""A"", which stands for ""for all"" or ""all"". <s> The corresponding symbol for the existential quantifier is ""∃"", a rotated letter ""E"", which stands for ""there exists"" or ""exists"". <s> An example of translating a quantified statement in a natural language such as English would be as follows. <s> Given the statement, ""Each of Peter's friends either likes to dance or likes to go to the beach,"" key aspects can be identified and rewritten using symbols including quantifiers. <s> So, let ""X"" be the set of all Peter's friends, ""P""(""x"") the predicate """"x"" likes to dance"", and ""Q""(""x"") the predicate """"x"" likes to go to the beach"". <s> Then the above sentence can be written in formal notation as formula_1, which is read, ""for every ""x"" that is a member of ""X"", ""P"" applies to ""x"" or ""Q"" applies to ""x""."" <s> The order of quantifiers is critical to meaning, as is illustrated by the following two propositions: This is clearly true; it just asserts that every natural number has a square. <s> The meaning of the assertion in which the order of quantifiers is inversed is different: This is clearly false; it asserts that there is a single natural number ""s"" that is at the same time the square of ""every"" natural number. <s> This is because the syntax directs that any variable cannot be a function of subsequently introduced variables. <s> A few other quantifiers have been proposed over time. <s> In particular, the solution quantifier, noted § (section sign) and read ""those"". <s> For example, is read ""those ""n"" in N such that ""n"" ≤ 4 are in {0,1,2}."" <s> The same construct is expressible in set-builder notation as <s> Term logic, also called Aristotelian logic, treats quantification in a manner that is closer to natural language, and also less suited to formal analysis. <s> Term logic treated ""All"", ""Some"" and ""No"" in the 4th century BC, in an account also touching on the alethic modalities. <s> Gottlob Frege, in his 1879 ""Begriffsschrift"", was the first to employ a quantifier to bind a variable ranging over a domain of discourse and appearing in predicates. <s> He would universally quantify a variable (or relation) by writing the variable over a dimple in an otherwise straight line appearing in his diagrammatic formulas. <s> Frege did not devise an explicit notation for existential quantification, instead employing his equivalent of ~∀""x""~, or contraposition. <s> Frege's treatment of quantification went largely unremarked until Bertrand Russell's 1903 ""Principles of Mathematics"". <s> In work that culminated in Peirce (1885), Charles Sanders Peirce and his student Oscar Howard Mitchell independently invented universal and existential quantifiers, and bound variables. <s> Peirce and Mitchell wrote Π and Σ where we now write ∀""x"" and ∃""x"". <s> Peirce's notation can be found in the writings of Ernst Schröder, Leopold Loewenheim, Thoralf Skolem, and Polish logicians into the 1950s. <s> Most notably, it is the notation of Kurt Gödel's landmark 1930 paper on the completeness of first-order logic, and 1931 paper on the incompleteness of Peano arithmetic. <s> Peirce's approach to quantification also influenced William Ernest Johnson and Giuseppe Peano, who invented yet another notation, namely (""x"") for the universal quantification of ""x"" and (in 1897) ∃""x"" for the existential quantification of ""x"". <s> Hence for decades, the canonical notation in philosophy and mathematical logic was (""x"")""P"" to express ""all individuals in the domain of discourse have the property ""P"","" and ""(∃""x"")""P"""" for ""there exists at least one individual in the domain of discourse having the property ""P""."" <s> Peano, who was much better known than Peirce, in effect diffused the latter's thinking throughout Europe. <s> Peano's notation was adopted by the ""Principia Mathematica"" of Whitehead and Russell, Quine, and Alonzo Church. <s> In 1935, Gentzen introduced the ∀ symbol, by analogy with Peano's ∃ symbol. <s> ∀ did not become canonical until the 1960s.","For example, every natural number has another natural number larger than it. <s> Two basic kinds of quantifiers used in predicate logic are

Hans von Bülow,39749,"Hans Guido Freiherr von Bülow (January 8, 1830February 12, 1894) was a German conductor, virtuoso pianist, and composer of the Romantic era. <s> As one of the most distinguished conductors of the 19th century, his activity was critical for establishing the successes of several major composers of the time, especially Richard Wagner and Johannes Brahms. <s> Alongside Carl Tausig, Bülow was perhaps the most prominent of the early students of Hungarian virtuoso pianist, conductor and composer Franz Liszt—therein performed the first public performance of Liszt's Sonata in B minor in 1857. <s> He became acquainted with, fell in love and eventually married Liszt's daughter Cosima, who later left him for Wagner. <s> Noted for his interpretation of the works of Ludwig van Beethoven, he was one of the earliest European musicians to tour the United States. <s> Bülow was born in Dresden, to members of the prominent Bülow family. <s> From the age of nine, he was a student of Friedrich Wieck (the father of Clara Schumann). <s> However, his parents insisted that he study law instead of music, and they sent him to Leipzig. <s> There he met Franz Liszt, and on hearing some music of Richard Wagner—specifically, the premiere of ""Lohengrin"" in 1850—he decided to ignore the dictates of his parents and make himself a career in music instead. <s> He studied the piano in Leipzig with the famous pedagogue Louis Plaidy. <s> He obtained his first conducting job in Zurich, on Wagner's recommendation, in 1850. <s> Bülow had a strongly acerbic personality and a loose tongue; this alienated many musicians whom he worked with. <s> He was dismissed from his Zurich job for this reason, but at the same time he was beginning to win renown for his ability to conduct new and complex works without a score. <s> In 1851, he became a student of Liszt, marrying his daughter Cosima in 1857. <s> They had two daughters: Daniela, born in 1860 and Blandina, born in 1863. <s> During the 1850s and early 1860s he was active as a pianist, conductor, and writer, and became well known throughout Germany as well as Russia. <s> In 1857, he premiered Liszt's Piano Sonata in B minor in Berlin. <s> In 1864 he became the Hofkapellmeister in Munich, and it was at this post he achieved his principal renown. <s> He conducted the premieres of two Wagner operas, ""Tristan und Isolde"" and ""Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg"", in 1865 and 1868 respectively; both were immensely successful. <s> Meanwhile, however, Cosima had been carrying on an affair with Richard Wagner and gave birth to their daughter Isolde in 1865. <s> Two years later, they had another daughter, Eva. <s> Although Cosima and Wagner's affair was now open knowledge, Bülow still refused to grant his wife a divorce. <s> Finally, she gave birth to one final child––a son, Siegfried––and it was only then that the conductor at last relented. <s> Their divorce was finalized in 1870, after which Cosima and Wagner married. <s> Bülow never spoke to Wagner again and he did not see his former wife for 11 years afterwards, although he apparently continued to respect the composer on a professional level, as he still conducted his works and mourned Wagner's death in 1883. <s> In July 1882 he married the actress Marie Schanzer. <s> In addition to championing the music of Wagner, Bülow was a supporter of the music of both Brahms and Tchaikovsky. <s> He was the soloist in the world premiere of the Tchaikovsky Piano Concerto No. 1 in B-flat minor in Boston in 1875. <s> He was also a devotee of Frédéric Chopin's music;

Bülow had called him the ""Knight of the Swine ""Schwein"""". <s> In 1880 he moved to Meiningen where he took the equivalent post, and where he built the Meiningen Court Orchestra into one of the finest in Germany; among his other demands, he insisted that the musicians learn to play all their parts from memory. <s> It was during his five years in Meiningen that he met Richard Strauss (though the meeting actually took place in Berlin). <s> His first opinion of the young composer was not favorable, but he changed his mind when he was confronted with a sample of Strauss's ""Serenade"". <s> Later on, he used his influence to give Strauss his first regular employment as a conductor. <s> Like Strauss, Bülow was attracted to the ideas of Max Stirner, whom he reputedly had known personally. <s> In April 1892 Bülow closed his final performance with the Berlin Philharmonic (where he had been serving as Principal Conductor since 1887) with a speech ""exalting"" the ideas of Stirner. <s> Together with John Henry Mackay, Stirner's biographer, he placed a memorial plaque at Stirner's last residence in Berlin. <s> Some of his orchestral innovations included the addition of the five-string bass and the pedal timpani;

Arch bridge,15435,"An arch bridge is a bridge with abutments at each end shaped as a curved arch. <s> Arch bridges work by transferring the weight of the bridge and its loads partially into a horizontal thrust restrained by the abutments at either side. <s> A viaduct (a long bridge) may be made from a series of arches, although other more economical structures are typically used today. <s> Possibly the oldest existing arch bridge is the Mycenaean Arkadiko Bridge in Greece from about 1300 BC. <s> The stone corbel arch bridge is still used by the local populace. <s> The well-preserved Hellenistic Eleutherna Bridge has a triangular corbel arch. <s> The 4th century BC Rhodes Footbridge rests on an early voussoir arch. <s> Although true arches were already known by the Etruscans and ancient Greeks, the Romans were – as with the vault and the dome – the first to fully realize the potential of arches for bridge construction. <s> A list of Roman bridges compiled by the engineer Colin O'Connor features 330 Roman stone bridges for traffic, 34 Roman timber bridges and 54 Roman aqueduct bridges, a substantial part still standing and even used to carry vehicles. <s> A more complete survey by the Italian scholar Vittorio Galliazzo found 931 Roman bridges, mostly of stone, in as many as 26 different countries (including former Yugoslavia). <s> Roman arch bridges were usually semicircular, although a number were segmental arch bridges (such as Alconétar Bridge), a bridge which has a curved arch that is less than a semicircle. <s> The advantages of the segmental arch bridge were that it allowed great amounts of flood water to pass under it, which would prevent the bridge from being swept away during floods and the bridge itself could be more lightweight. <s> Generally, Roman bridges featured wedge-shaped primary arch stones (voussoirs) of the same in size and shape. <s> The Romans built both single spans and lengthy multiple arch aqueducts, such as the Pont du Gard and Segovia Aqueduct. <s> Their bridges featured from an early time onwards flood openings in the piers, e.g. in the Pons Fabricius in Rome (62 BC), one of the world's oldest major bridges still standing. <s> The Romans also introduced segmental arch bridges into bridge construction. <s> The 330 m Limyra Bridge in southwestern Turkey features 26 segmental arches with an average span-to-rise ratio of 5.3:1, giving the bridge an unusually flat profile unsurpassed for more than a millennium. <s> Trajan's bridge over the Danube featured open-spandrel segmental arches made of wood (standing on 40 m concrete piers). <s> This was to be the longest arch bridge for a thousand years both in terms of overall and individual span length, while the longest extant Roman bridge is the 790 m long Puente Romano at Mérida. <s> The late Roman Karamagara Bridge in Cappadocia may represent the earliest surviving bridge featuring a pointed arch. <s> In medieval Europe, bridge builders improved on the Roman structures by using narrower piers, thinner arch barrels and higher span to rise ratios on bridges. <s> Gothic pointed arches were also introduced, reducing lateral thrust, and spans increased as with the eccentric Puente del Diablo (1282). <s> The 14th century in particular saw bridge building reaching new heights. <s> Span lengths of 40 m , previously unheard of in the history of masonry arch construction, were now reached in places as diverse as Spain (Puente de San Martín), Italy (Castelvecchio Bridge) and France (Devil's bridge and Pont Grand) and with arch types as different as semi-circular, pointed and segmental arches. <s> The bridge at Trezzo sull'Adda, destroyed in the 15th century, even featured a span length of 72 m , not matched until 1796. <s> Stone, brick and other such materials are strong in compression and somewhat so in shear, but cannot resist much force in tension. <s> As a result, masonry arch bridges are designed to be constantly under compression, so far as is possible. <s> Each arch is constructed over a temporary falsework frame, known as a centring. <s> In the first compression arch bridges, a keystone in the middle of the bridge bore the weight of the rest of the bridge. <s> The more weight that was put onto the bridge, the stronger its structure became. <s> Masonry arch bridges use a quantity of fill material (typically compacted rubble) above the arch in order to increase this dead-weight on the bridge and prevent tension from occurring in the arch ring as loads move across the bridge. <s> Other materials that were used to build this type of bridge were brick and unreinforced concrete. <s> When masonry (cut stone) is used the angles of the faces are cut to minimize shear forces. <s> Where

Jewish Territorial Organization,54466,"The Jewish Territorial Organisation, known as the ITO, was a Jewish political movement which first arose in 1903 in response to the British Uganda Offer, but which was institutionalized in 1905. <s> Its main goal was to find an alternative territory to that of the Land of Israel, which was preferred by the Zionist movement, for the creation of a Jewish homeland. <s> The organization embraced what became known as ""Jewish Territorialism"" also known as ""Jewish Statism"" (though not to be confused with the political philosophy of the same name). <s> The ITO was dissolved in 1925. <s> The Jewish Colonization Association, created in 1891 by the Baron Maurice de Hirsch, was aimed at facilitating mass emigration of Jews from the Russian Empire and other Eastern European countries, by settling them in agricultural colonies on lands purchased by the committee, particularly in North and South America (especially Argentina). <s> Before 1905 some Zionist leaders took seriously proposals for Jewish homelands in places other than the Land of Israel. <s> Theodor Herzl hoped for a Jewish homeland in the Land of Israel but recognized that global events demanded an immediate solution to the Jewish problem, in Russia at least, even if that solution required Jewish refugees to settle outside of Eretz Israel. <s> Theodor Herzl's ""Der Judenstaat"" argued for a Jewish state in either Palestine, ""our ever-memorable historic home"", or Argentina, ""one of the most fertile countries in the world"". <s> Many of the socialist Zionist groups were more territorialist than Zionist, such as Nachman Syrkin's Zionist Socialist Workers Party (the Z.S.). <s> In 1903 British cabinet ministers suggested the British Uganda Program, land for a Jewish state in ""Uganda"" (actually in modern Kenya). <s> Herzl initially rejected the idea, preferring Palestine, but after the April 1903 Kishinev pogrom Herzl introduced a controversial proposal to the Sixth Zionist Congress to investigate the offer as a temporary measure for Russian Jews in danger. <s> Notwithstanding its emergency and temporary nature, the proposal still proved very divisive, and widespread opposition to the plan was demonstrated by a walkout led by the Russian Jewish delegation to the Congress. <s> Few historians believe that such a settlement scheme could have attracted immigrants, Jewish financial support, or international political support. <s> Since there was strong support on the part of some members of the Zionist leadership, however, peace was kept in the movement by the time-honored parliamentary maneuver of voting to establish a committee for the investigation of the possibility, which was not finally dismissed until the 7th Zionist Congress in 1905. <s> The Jewish Territorial Organization (ITO) was founded by British Jewish author, critic, and activist Israel Zangwill and British Jewish journalist Lucien Wolf in 1903 and institutionalized in 1905. <s> The establishment was a response to Herzl's rejection of Uganda proposal, as the ITO led by Zangwill split off from the Zionist movement. <s> It attempted to locate territory suitable for Jewish settlement in various parts of America (e.g. Galveston), and on the African, Asian, and Australian continents, yet with little success. <s> In 1905 the members of the Seventh Zionist Congress formally rejected the Uganda Scheme. <s> Following the rejection of the East Africa offer, Zangwill contacted Lucien Wolf, an English Jewish journalist and member of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, the main representative body of Anglo Jewry. <s> Wolf was an opponent of political Zionism, but did support the creation of Jewish colonies in the Diaspora. <s> In August 1905 Zangwill and Wolf met to discuss the Uganda Scheme, and in subsequent correspondence between the two we learn that both supported the creation of a Jewish colony in British East Africa. <s> Wolf had objected to any specifically ""Jewish national homeland"", that is to say a state which ghettoized Jews, preserving Jewish customs and law as the basis for governance. <s> Though Zangwill's literary works suggest his nostalgia for the ghetto, he too recognized the need for a modern Jewish polity. <s> Both concurred that a self-governing Jewish territory should be based on a preponderance of Jews in the region rather than British legislative fiat, and both concurred that the new government should be formed on a modern, democratic basis rather than some earlier biblical ideal or Eastern European Kehilla structure. <s> This basic agreement between Zangwill and Wolf would lead to the formation of the Jewish Territorial Organisation (ITO), an organisation dedicated to ""obtaining a large tract of territory (preferably within the British Empire) wherein to found a Jewish Home of Refuge"", and to the elevation of Zangwill to the ITO presidency. <s> After the October Revolution there was in the USSR a Territorialist effort in Ukraine, the Crimea and then in a region surrounding Birobidzhan, where a Jewish Autonomous Region was established in 1934. <s> (The Jewish Autonomous Oblast (JAO) ( , ""Yevreyskaya avtonomnaya oblast""; ) is still today an autonomous oblast situated in Russia's far east.) <s> In the United States, the Organization for Jewish Colonization in Russia worked to encourage the emigration and settlement of Jews there. <s> In the face of the looming Nazi genocide, Isaac Nachman Steinberg established the Freeland League for Jewish Territorial Colonization in the United States in 1935. <s> This organization attempted, unsuccessfully, to pursue Jewish autonomy by obtaining a large piece of territory in sparsely populated areas in Ecuador, Australia, or Surinam. <s> One of the more well-known ventures was the Kimberley Plan, to secure land in Australia. <s> The Kimberley Plan was officially vetoed on 15 July 1944 by Australian Prime Minister, John Curtin, who informed Steinberg that the Australian government would not ""depart from the long-established policy in regard to alien settlement in Australia"" and could not ""entertain the proposal for a group settlement of the exclusive type contemplated by the Freeland League"". <s> After the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, Steinberg criticized the exclusivist politics of the Israeli government and continued his attempts to create a non-nationalist Jewish settlement in some other region of the world. <s> After Steinberg's death in 1957 the Freeland League was led by Mordkhe Schaechter, who gradually changed the focus of the organization to more cultural, Yiddishist goals.","Territorialism, also known as Statism (but not to be confused with another belief also called

in Central Europe. <s> In 1900, with a company workforce of 32, Slavia exports began and 150 machines were shipped to London for the Hewtson firm. <s> Shortly afterwards, the press credited them as
