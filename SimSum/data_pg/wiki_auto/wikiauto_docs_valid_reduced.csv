Shannon Pot on the slopes of Cuilcagh is the source of the River Shannon, the longest river in Ireland at 386 km . <s> The River Erne is a major river which rises from Beaghy Lough, two miles (3 km) south of Stradone in Cavan and flows for 120 km to Lough Erne. <s> Other rivers in the county include the Blackwater River, which rises near Bailieborough and flows through Lough Ramor, joining the River Boyne at Navan; the Dee which springs near Bailieborough; the River Annalee which flows from Lough Sillan and joins the Erne; and the Cladagh river which rises from Cuilcagh and flows into Fermanagh. <s> The Glyde and the Owenroe also source in Cavan. <s> Cavan is known as 'The Lakeland County' and is reputed to contain 365 lakes. <s> At 18.8 km2 , Lough Sheelin is the county's largest lake; it is situated in the south of the county and forms a three way border on its waters between counties Meath, Westmeath and Cavan. <s> A large complex of lakes form in the north and west of Cavan into designated Specially Protected Areas (SPA); an example is Lough Oughter. <s> Other important wildlife protected lakes such as Lough Gowna and Lough Ramor are in the south and east of the county. <s> Cavan has a mainly hilly (drumlin) landscape and contains just under 7000 ha of forested area, 3.6% of Cavan's total land area. <s> The county contains forests such as Bellamont Forest near Cootehill, Killykeen Forest Park at Lough Oughter (a Coillte state forest concern), Dún na Rí Forest Park and the Burren Forest. <s> In medieval times, the area of Cavan was part of the petty kingdom of East Bréifne or Brefney O'Reilly after its ruling Gaelic family. <s> This in turn was a division of the 11th century Kingdom of Bréifne. <s> For this reason the county is colloquially known as the Breffni County. <s> A high degree of defence was achieved by using the natural landscape of drumlin hills and loughs. <s> The poorly drained heavy clay soils contributed as an obstacle against invasion. <s> Historically, Cavan was part of the western province of Connacht, but was transferred to Ulster in 1584 following the composition of Breifne. <s> In the south, the Lough Sheelin area was part of Leinster until the late 14th century. <s> Parts of Cavan were subjected to Norman influence from the twelfth century and the remains of several motte and bailie fortifications are still visible mainly in the east of the county, as well as the remains of stronger works such as Castlerahan and Clogh Oughter castle. <s> The influence of several monastic orders also owes its origins to around this time with abbey remains existent in locations such as Drumlane and Trinity Island. <s> The Plantation of Ulster from 1610 saw the settlement and origins of several new towns within the county that include Bailieborough, Cootehill, Killeshandra and Virginia. <s> Existing towns such as Cavan and Belturbet became over time more important as trading centres. <s> Wars during the mid-seventeenth century aimed at trying to unsettle the Plantation only led to further plantations of English and Scottish settlers into the county and the beginnings of a thriving flax and linen

Gaelic, ) is a county in Ireland. <s> It is part of the Border Region as it is on the border with Northern Ireland. <s> It is part of the province of Ulster. <s> It is named after the town of Cavan. <s> Cavan borders six other counties: Leitrim to the west, Fermanagh and Monaghan to the north, Meath to the south-east, Longford to the south-west and Westmeath to the south. <s> The county has a lot of countryside with many lakes and small hills called drumlins. <s> Not many people live in the north-western area of the county as there are many mountains. <s> The highest point of the county is in the Breifne mountains, mount Cuilcagh at 665 m. <s> Many rivers in Ireland start in County Cavan. <s> The Shannon Pot is the source of the River Shannon, the longest river in Ireland at 386 km. <s> The River Erne is a major river which rises from Beaghy Lough south of Stradone in Cavan and flows for 120 km to Lough Erne. <s> Cavan is known as 'The Lakeland County' and it is said it has 365 lakes, one for every day of the year. <s> At 18.8 km2, Lough Sheelin is the county's largest lake situated in the south of the county. <s> A large area of lakes in the north and west of Cavan are marked as Specially Protected Areas (SPA), example of this being Lough Oughter. <s> Other important wildlife protected lakes such as Lough Gowna and Lough Ramor are in the south and east of the county. <s> The county contains forests such as Bellamont Forest near Cootehill, Killykeen Forest Park at Lough Oughter (a Coillte state forest), Dún na Rí Forest Park and the Burren Forest. <s> In medieval times, the area of Cavan was part of East Bréifne after its ruling Gaelic family. <s> This in was a division of the 11th century Kingdom of Bréifne. <s> For this reason the county is also sometimes known as the Breffni County. <s> The natural landscape of drumlin hills and loughs made a good defence against invaders. <s> Historically, Cavan was part of the western province of Connacht, but was transferred to Ulster in 1584 when Bréifne was shired and became the county of Cavan. <s> In the south, the Lough Sheelin area was part of Leinster until the late 14th century. <s> Parts of Cavan were under Norman influence from the twelfth century. <s> The remains of several buildings from the time can still be seen at Castlerahan and Clogh Oughter castle. <s> There are also some remains of early abbeys in the county, like at Drumlane and Trinity Island. <s> The Plantation of Ulster from 1610 saw the settlement and origins of several new towns within the county like Bailieborough, Cootehill, Killeshandra and Virginia. <s> Existing towns such as Cavan and Belturbet became over time more important as trading centres. <s> Wars aimed at trying to unsettle the Plantation only led to further plantations of English and Scottish settlers into the county and the beginnings of a thriving flax and linen industry. <s> Agriculture is the largest industry in the county, especially dairy milk processing as well as pig and beef farming. <s> Much of Cavan's land is clay soils, which are rich in minerals, but heavy and poorly drained, making pasture farming the

Second Party System,7570,"Historians and political scientists consider the Second Party System to be a term of periodization to designate the political party system operating in the United States from about 1828 to 1854, after the First Party System ended. <s> The system was characterized by rapidly rising levels of voter interest, beginning in 1828, as demonstrated by Election Day turnouts, rallies, partisan newspapers, and high degrees of personal loyalty to parties. <s> Two major parties dominated the political landscape: the Democratic Party, led by Andrew Jackson, and the Whig Party, assembled by Henry Clay from the National Republicans and from other opponents of Jackson. <s> Minor parties included the Anti-Masonic Party, an important innovator from 1827 to 1834; the abolitionist Liberty Party in 1840; and the anti-slavery expansion Free Soil Party in 1848 and 1852. <s> The Second Party System reflected and shaped the political, social, economic and cultural currents of the Jacksonian Era, until succeeded by the Third Party System. <s> Historian Richard P. McCormick is most responsible for defining the term. <s> Among the best-known figures on the Democratic side were: Andrew Jackson, Martin Van Buren, John C. Calhoun, James K. Polk, Lewis Cass, and Stephen Douglas. <s> On the Whig side were John Quincy Adams, Henry Clay, Daniel Webster, William H. Seward, and Thurlow Weed. <s> The 1824 presidential election operated without political parties and came down to a four-man race. <s> Each candidate (Henry Clay, William Crawford, Andrew Jackson, and John Quincy Adams), all of whom were nominally Democratic Republicans, had a regional base of support involving factions in the various states. <s> With no electoral college majority, the choice devolved on the United States House of Representatives. <s> Clay was not among the three finalists, but as Speaker of the House he negotiated the settlement. <s> Jackson, despite having won the most popular votes and the most electoral votes, was not elected. <s> John Quincy Adams, son of former President John Adams, was elected, and he immediately chose Clay as Secretary of State. <s> Jackson loudly denounced this ""corrupt bargain."" <s> Campaigning vigorously he launched a crusade against the corruption he saw in Washington. <s> Appealing both to local militia companies (as the most famous of the nation's Indian fighters, and a hero of the War of 1812) and to state political factions, Jackson assembled a coalition, the embryonic Democratic Party, that ousted Adams in 1828. <s> Martin Van Buren, brilliant leader of New York politics, was Jackson's key aide, bringing along the large electoral votes of Virginia and Pennsylvania. <s> His reward was appointment as Secretary of State and later nomination and election to the vice presidency as heir to the Jacksonian tradition. <s> The Adams-Clay wing of the Democratic-Republican Party became known as the National Republicans, although Adams never considered himself a loyal member of the party. <s> Jackson considered himself a reformer, but he was committed to the old ideals of Republicanism, and bitterly opposed anything that smacked of special favors for special interests. <s> While Jackson never engaged in a duel as president, he had shot political opponents before and was just as determined to destroy his enemies on the battlefields of politics. <s> The Second Party System came about primarily because of Jackson's determination to destroy the Second Bank of the United States. <s> Headquartered in Philadelphia, with offices in major cities around the country, the federally chartered Bank operated somewhat like a central bank (like the Federal Reserve System a century later). <s> Local bankers and politicians annoyed by the controls exerted by Nicholas Biddle grumbled loudly. <s> Jackson did not like any banks (paper money was anathema to Jackson; he believed only gold and silver ""specie"" should circulate.) <s> After Herculean battles with Henry Clay, his chief antagonist, Jackson finally broke Biddle's bank. <s> Jackson continued to attack the banking system. <s> His ""Specie Circular"" of July 1836 rejected paper money issued by banks (it could no longer be used to buy federal land), insisting on gold and silver coins. <s> Most businessmen and bankers (but not all) went over to the Whig party, and the commercial and industrial cities became Whig strongholds. <s> Jackson meanwhile became even more popular with the subsistence farmers and day laborers who distrusted bankers and finance. <s> Jackson systematically used the federal patronage system, what was called the ""Spoils System"". <s> Jackson not only rewarded past supporters; he promised future jobs if local and state politicians joined his team. <s> As Syrett explains: When Jackson became President, he implemented the theory of rotation in office, declaring it ""a leading principle in the republican creed."" <s> He believed that rotation in office would prevent the development of a corrupt civil service. <s> On the other hand, Jackson's supporters wanted to use the civil service to reward party loyalists to make the party stronger. <s> In practice, this meant replacing civil servants with friends or party loyalists into those offices. <s> The spoils system did not originate with Jackson. <s> It originated under Thomas Jefferson when he removed Federalist office-holders after becoming president. <s> Also, Jackson did not out the entire civil service. <s> At the end of his term, Jackson had only dismissed less than twenty percent of the original civil service. <s> While Jackson did not start the spoils system, he did encourage its growth and it became a central feature of the Second Party System, as well as the Third Party System, until it ended in the 1890s. <s> As one historian explains: ""Although Jackson dismissed far fewer government employees than most of his contemporaries imagined and although he did not originate the spoils system, he made more sweeping changes in the Federal bureaucracy than had any of his predecessors.","It is a phrase used by historians and political scientists to describe the time period between 1828 and 1854. <s> People quickly became more interested in voting starting in 1828. <s> One was the Democratic Party, led by Andrew Jackson. <s> The other was the Whig Party, started by Henry Clay. <s> The Whig party was made up of members of the National Republican Party and other people who opposed Jackson. <s> The Anti-Masonic Party (1827-34) was important in developing political ideas and laws. <s> The United States Free Soil Party in 1848 and 1852 was another anti-slavery party. <s> The Second Party System was an important part of the politics, society, economics, and culture of the Jacksonian Era. <s> The phrase ""second party system"" was defined by the historian Richard P.

Prince of Orange,15679,"Prince of Orange (or Princess of Orange if the holder is female) is a title originally associated with the sovereign Principality of Orange, in what is now southern France. <s> Under the Treaty of Utrecht of 1713, Frederick William I of Prussia ceded the Principality of Orange to King Louis XIV of France (while retaining the title as part of his dynastic titulature). <s> After William III of England died without children, a dispute arose between Johan Willem Friso and Frederick I of Prussia, which was settled in the Treaty of Partition (1732); consequently, Friso's son, William IV had to share use of the title ""Prince of Orange"" (which had accumulated prestige in the Netherlands and throughout the Protestant world) with Frederick William I of Prussia. <s> With the emergence of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, the title is traditionally borne by the heir apparent of the Dutch monarch. <s> Originally only worn by men, since 1983 the title descends via absolute primogeniture, which means that the holder can be either Prince or Princess of Orange. <s> The Dutch royal dynasty, the House of Orange-Nassau, is not the only family to claim the dynastical title. <s> Rival claims to the title have been made by German emperors and kings of the House of Hohenzollern and by the head of the French noble family of Mailly. <s> The current users of the title are Princess Catharina-Amalia of the Netherlands (Orange-Nassau), Georg Friedrich, Prince of Prussia (Hohenzollern), and Guy, Marquis de Mailly-Nesle (Mailly). <s> The title originally referred to Orange in the Vaucluse department in the Rhone valley of southern France, which was a property of the House of Orange, then of the House of Baux and the House of Châlon-Arlay before passing in 1544 to the House of Orange-Nassau. <s> The last descendant of the original princes, René of Châlon, left the principality to his cousin William the Silent, who was not a descendant of the original Orange family but the heir to the principality of Orange by testament, however in violation against the inheritance pattern enacted by the last will of Marie des Baux, the Princess of Orange through kinship to whom Prince René derived his own right thereto. <s> In 1673, Louis XIV of France annexed all territory of the principality to France and to the royal domain, as part of the war actions against the stadtholder William III of Orange — who later became King William III of Great Britain. <s> Orange ceased to exist as a sovereign realm, de facto. <s> After the marquis (who died in 1713), the next holder was , marquis de Nesle (1689–1764). <s> Although no longer descended from Louis-Charles, a branch of the Mailly family still claim the title today. <s> In 1714 Louis XIV bestowed the usufruct of the principality on his kinsman, Louis Armand of Bourbon, Prince de Conti. <s> After his death in 1727 the principality was deemed merged in the Crown by 1731. <s> Because William III died without legitimate children, the principality was regarded as having been inherited by his closest cognate relative on the basis of the testament of Frederic-Henry, Frederick I of Prussia, who ceded the principality — at least the lands, but not the formal title — to France in 1713. <s> France supported his claim. <s> In this way, the territory of the principality lost its feudal and secular privileges and became a part of France. <s> The Treaty of Utrecht allowed the King of Prussia to erect part of the duchy of Gelderland (the cities of Geldern, Straelen and Wachtendonk with their

Orange"". <s> The kings of Prussia and the German emperors styled themselves Princes of Orange till 1918. <s> An agnatic relative of William III, John William Friso of Nassau, who was also cognatically descended from William the Silent, was designated the heir to the princes of Orange in the Netherlands by the last will of William III. <s> Several of his descendants became stadtholders. <s> They claim the principality of Orange on the basis of agnatic inheritance, similar to that of William the Silent, who had inherited Orange from his cousin René of Châlon. <s> They did however have a claim, albeit distant, to the principality itself due to John William Friso's descent from Louise de Coligny, who was a descendant of the original Princes of Orange. <s> (Louise's great grandmother, Anne Pot, Countess of St. Pol, was a descendant of Tiburge d'Orange, who married into the des Baux family) <s> They also claimed on the basis of the testament of Philip William, Maurice

any of this, nor allowed the Orange-Nassaus or the Hohenzollerns to obtain anything of the principality itself. <s> The Oranje-Nassaus nevertheless assumed the title and also erected several of their lordships into a new principality of Orange. <s> From that derivation of the title comes the tradition of the house of Nassau-Dietz, the later stadtholders of the Netherlands, and the present-day

white gypsum soil found in the area. <s> Kow Swamp is now a permanent water body, due to its use for irrigation storage, 15 kilometres in circumference, with an average depth of 3 metres. <s> Originally a low lying swamp, it was filled when the Murray River is in flood or running at high levels, while Bendigo creek provides a smaller amount of water. <s> There is evidence of recent Aboriginal occupation of the area from canoe trees and middens, while early settlers' records describe an Aboriginal ceremonial site on the north side of the swamp. <s> The most notable evidence was the discovery in 1925, on the west side of the swamp, of the Cohuna Cranium by a local earthmoving contractor. <s> The editor of the local newspaper ""Cohuna Farmers Weekly"" notified authorities and

""grande cuisine"", the ""high art"" of French cooking: a grandiose style of cookery favoured by both international royalty and by the newly rich of Paris. <s> Carême is often considered one of the first internationally renowned celebrity chefs. <s> Abandoned by his parents in Paris in 1794 at the height of the French Revolution, he worked as a kitchen boy at a cheap Parisian chophouse in exchange for room and board. <s> In 1798, he was formally apprenticed to Sylvain Bailly, a famous ""pâtissier"" with a shop near the Palais-Royal. <s> The post-revolutionary Palais-Royal was a high profile, fashionable neighborhood filled with vibrant life and bustling crowds. <s> Bailly recognized his talent and ambition. <s> By the time he was prepared to leave Bailly, he could stipulate that he should be free to leave his new employer when a better offer came along. <s> Carême opened his own shop, the ""Pâtisserie de la rue de la Paix"", which he maintained until 1813. <s> Carême gained fame in Paris for his ""pièces montées"", elaborate constructions used as centerpieces, which Bailly had displayed in the pâtisserie window. <s> He made these confections, which were sometimes several feet high, entirely out of foodstuffs such as sugar, marzipan, and pastry. <s> He modeled them on temples, pyramids, and ancient ruins, taking ideas from architectural history books which he studied at the nearby Bibliothèque Nationale, thanks to the enlightened attitude of his first employer Bailly. <s> He is credited with the inventions of ""gros nougats"" and ""grosses meringues"", ""croquantes"", made of almonds and honey, and ""solilemmes"". <s> He did freelance work creating pieces principally for the French diplomat and gourmand Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord, but also other members of Parisian high society, including Napoleon. <s> While working on his confections at many private kitchens, he quickly extended his culinary skills to main courses. <s> Napoleon was famously indifferent to food, but he understood the importance of social relations in the world of diplomacy. <s> In 1804, he gave money to Talleyrand to purchase Château de Valençay, a large estate outside Paris. <s> The château was intended to act as a kind of diplomatic gathering place. <s> When Talleyrand moved there, he took Carême with him. <s> Carême was set a test by Talleyrand: to create a whole year’s worth of menus, without repetition, and using only seasonal produce. <s> Carême passed the test and completed his training in

accepted the invitation of Tsar Alexander I to come to St. Petersburg, but stayed so briefly that he prepared not even a single meal for the Tsar. <s> Upon returning to Paris, he became chef to banker James Mayer Rothschild. <s> Carême died in his Paris house on the Rue Neuve Saint Roche at the age of 48, due perhaps to many years inhaling the toxic fumes of the coal burning stoves over which he cooked. <s> He is remembered as the founder of the haute cuisine concept and is interred in the Montmartre Cemetery in Paris. <s> In his first major position, Carême worked as ""chef de cuisine"" to Talleyrand, who actively encouraged Carême in the development of a new refined food style using herbs, fresh vegetables, and simplified sauces with few ingredients. <s> Talleyrand became a famous host during the Congress of Vienna—by the time the congress disbanded, not only the map of Europe but also the culinary tastes of its upper classes had been thoroughly revised. <s> Carême's impact on culinary matters ranged from trivial to theoretical. <s> He is credited with creating the standard chef's hat, the ""toque"", he designed new sauces and dishes, and he published a classification of all sauces into groups based on four mother sauces. <s> He is also frequently credited with replacing the practice of ""service à la française"" (serving all dishes at once) with ""service à la

one was centered 290 miles (490 km) south-southeast of Cape Cod and another was located 200 miles (320 km) south of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. <s> The first low quickly organized into an unnamed tropical storm, and the other area stayed broad and disorganized. <s> However, by July 18, the system became much better organized with improved banding features, and the area developed into Tropical Depression Two while located 220 miles (355 km) south-southeast of Cape Hatteras. <s> The depression moved slowly to the north-northwest through a break in the subtropical ridge, and as convective banding features became more visible the system strengthened into Tropical Storm Beryl. <s> Throughout much of its duration, the storm tracked through an environment with light vertical wind shear and well-established upper-level outflow. <s> Shortly after becoming a tropical storm, the low-level circulation of Beryl became exposed with limited deep convection, though deep convection re-developed the following morning. <s> Outflow continued to improve, and with warm sea surface temperatures Beryl slowly strengthened further to reach peak winds of 60 mph (95 km/h) early on July 20 while located about 120 miles (190 km) east of Nags Head, North Carolina. <s> Beryl maintained peak winds for about 18 hours as it paralleled the Mid-Atlantic and New Jersey coasts, during which an eye-like feature developed in the center of the convection. <s> Late on July 20, it began a slow weakening trend after passing over cooler waters. <s> Steering winds ahead of an approaching mid-level trough caused Beryl to speed up northeastward, and early on July 21 the center of the storm crossed the island of Nantucket. <s> The convection diminished as it moved through progressively colder waters, and shortly after 1200 UTC on July 21 Beryl became an extratropical cyclone a short distance east of Cape Cod. <s> Hours later, it made landfall in southwestern Nova Scotia, and on July 22 the extratropical remnants of Beryl merged with an approaching cold front over Newfoundland. <s> Forecasters originally predicted Beryl to brush the Carolinas; as such, a tropical storm watch was issued for the eastern coast of North Carolina from Cape Lookout northward to Currituck Beach Lighthouse. <s> When a more northeastward track became apparent, a tropical storm watch was issued about 33 hours before moving ashore from Woods Hole to Plymouth, Massachusetts, including Cape Cod, Nantucket, and Martha's Vineyard. <s> About 22 hours before landfall, the National Hurricane Center replaced the watch with a tropical storm warning for the same area, and also issued a tropical storm watch from Woods Hole, Massachusetts westward to New Haven, Connecticut and for the eastern portion of Long Island from east of Fire Island to Port Jefferson. <s> Expecting for the storm, the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency was activated as a trial run for the hurricane season. <s> Local Red Cross chapters were opened, as well, with two volunteer teams placed on standby to assist. <s> Across southeastern Massachusetts, police departments maintained extra staff in preparation for any potential problems from the storm. <s> Many fishermen secured their boats, while some business owners boarded up windows to prevent storm damage. <s> Several days prior to the passage of Beryl through Atlantic Canada, the Canadian Hurricane Centre issued gale warnings for the coastal waters off of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland. <s> In anticipation of heavy rainfall, the agency also issued heavy rainfall warnings for western Nova Scotia, including Halifax. <s> The storm caused high waves along the East Coast of the United States, with 19 foot seas (5.97 m) in the open ocean. <s> Waves along the southern coast of Nantucket reached 10 feet in height as the storm approached the island, resulting in four people being rescued by lifeguards from rip currents. <s> High surf was also reported along the southern coast of Massachusetts and Rhode Island. <s> Beryl also produced a storm surge of 0.9 feet on Nantucket. <s> Winds across southeastern Massachusetts were fairly light, with no sustained tropical storm force winds and wind gusts peaking at 44 mph;

of solo albums, temporary membership in his brother Neil's band Crowded House and joint efforts with Neil Finn as the Finn Brothers. <s> Brian Finn was born in Te Awamutu, New Zealand. <s> He went to Sacred Heart College, Auckland, a Catholic boarding school. <s> In 1971 he started a Bachelor of Arts degree at the University of Auckland. <s> There he jammed in music practice room 129 (later the name of a Split Enz song) with friends and future Split Enz bandmembers Mike Chunn, Robert Gillies, Philip Judd and Noel Crombie. <s> Music soon became more important to him than his studies. <s> In 1972 he quit university. <s> A few months later, Phil and Tim formed the group Split Ends, renamed Split Enz in 1975, shortly before they left New Zealand for Melbourne. <s> Their music moved towards a more mainstream sound in later years, with an eclecticism that incorporated influences from art rock, vaudeville, swing, punk, glam rock, rock and pop. <s> Between 1972 and 1977, Tim and Judd alternated as frontman for the band. <s> When Judd left the band, Tim Finn's younger brother Neil Finn took his place. <s> Finn had his first success away from Split Enz in 1981 when his discarded demo ""They Won't Let My Girlfriend Talk to Me"" became a top 10 hit for Australian band Jimmy and the Boys. <s> In 1983 Finn recorded his debut solo album, ""Escapade"", while still a member of Split Enz. <s> This met with major commercial success both in Australia and New Zealand, and yielded hit song ""Fraction Too Much Friction"", which revealed a more rhythm-based sound than Split Enz had been known for. <s> After contributing four songs to Split Enz album ""Conflicting Emotions"", Finn left the band permanently in June 1984, to focus on a solo career. <s> The following year he moved to London. <s> 1986 saw the release of his second solo album ""Big Canoe"". <s> The album utilised a wide variety of instrumentation, including guitars, orchestral backings and traditional Indian instruments - most notably on single ""No Thunder, No Fire, No Rain"", which was inspired by the Bhopal chemical disaster. <s> Though ""Big Canoe"" reached number three on the New Zealand charts, it failed to become the international breakthrough that Finn or record company Virgin had hoped. <s> During this time, Finn's focus also turned to soundtrack music, and he landed a few acting roles on-screen. <s> Finn has composed for a number of Australian films and TV productions, including 1981 teen tale ""Puberty Blues"" and comedy ""Les Patterson Saves the World"", which yielded Australian hit ""You Saved the World"". <s> Finn had a small part in Australian film ""The Coca-Cola Kid"" alongside then-girlfriend Greta Scacchi, and a larger one in her Italian-shot romance ""La Donna della Luna"" (The Moon Woman). <s> In late 1989, Finn was back living in Melbourne, recording his eponymous third album, ""Tim Finn"", for Capitol Records. <s> The album would yield strong reviews and New Zealand hit ""Parihaka"", based on a Maori village known for its campaign of passive resistance to European occupiers. <s> In early 1990, he began playing music with younger brother Neil, for an intended Finn brothers record. <s> After working together on some songs, Neil later proposed incorporating the tracks onto the latest album of Crowded House, the group he had formed after Split Enz

each eyeball is approximately 16 mm in diameter and is as large as, or in some cases larger than, its entire brain. <s> The unique cranial anatomy of the tarsier results from the need to balance their large eyes and heavy head so they are able to wait silently for nutritious prey. <s> Tarsiers have a strong auditory sense, and their auditory cortex is distinct. <s> Tarsiers also have long hind limbs, owing mostly to the elongated tarsus bones of the feet, from which the animals get their name. <s> The combination of their elongated tarsi and fused tibiofibulae makes them morphologically specialized for vertical clinging and leaping. <s> The head and body range from 10 to 15 cm in length, but the hind limbs are about twice this long (including the feet), and they also have a slender tail from 20 to 25 cm long. <s> Their fingers are also elongated, with the third finger being about the same length as the upper arm. <s> Most of the digits have nails, but the second and third toes of the hind feet bear claws instead, which are used for grooming. <s> Tarsiers have soft, velvety fur, which is generally buff, beige, or ochre in color. <s> Unlike many nocturnal vertebrates, tarsiers lack a light-reflecting layer (tapetum lucidum) of the retina and have a fovea. <s> The tarsier's brain is different from that of other primates in terms of the arrangement of the connections between the two eyes and the lateral geniculate nucleus, which is the main region of the thalamus that receives visual information. <s> The sequence of cellular layers receiving information from the ipsilateral (same side of the head) and contralateral (opposite side of the head) eyes in the lateral geniculate nucleus distinguishes tarsiers from lemurs, lorises, and monkeys, which are all similar in this respect. <s> Some neuroscientists suggested that ""this apparent difference distinguishes tarsiers from all other primates, reinforcing the view that they arose in an early, independent line of primate evolution."" <s> Tarsiers are the only extant entirely carnivorous primates: they are primarily insectivorous, and catch insects by jumping at them. <s> They are also known to prey on birds, snakes, lizards, and bats. <s> Gestation takes about six months, and tarsiers give birth to single offspring. <s> Young tarsiers are born furred, and with open eyes, and are able to climb within a day of birth. <s> They reach sexual maturity by the end of their second year. <s> Sociality and mating system varies, with tarsiers from Sulawesi living in small family groups, while Philippine and western tarsiers are reported to sleep and forage alone. <s> Tarsiers tend to be extremely shy animals.","They were once widespread, but now tarsiers live only on islands in south-east Asia. <s> Fossils are found in Asia, Europe, and North America, and some disputed fossils from Africa. <s> The fossil record shows that their teeth have not changed much, except in size, in the past 45 million years. <s> They also have the longest continuous fossil record of any primate. <s> They have large eyes. <s> Each is about 16 mm wide.They are very sensitive to touch, and weigh as much as their entire brain. <s> Unlike many nocturnal animals, tarsiers lack a light-reflecting area (tapetum lucidum) of the eye. <s> They also have a fovea, which is also not usual in nocturnal animals. <s> The tarsier's brain is different from other primates in one respect. <s> The sequence of cell layers in the lateral geniculate nucleus getting information from both eyes is different from the set-up in lemurs, lorises, and monkeys. <s> ""This apparent difference distinguishes tarsiers from all other primates, and reinforces the view that they arose in an early, independent line of primate evolution"". <s> Tarsiers are the only primates which are wholly carnivorous. <s> They mainly eat insects, but some are also known to eat birds and snakes. <s> Pregnancy takes about six months, which is a long time for such a small animal. <s> Tarsiers give birth to single offspring. <s> Tarsiers have incredibly good hearing.","['delete', 'rephrase', 'ssplit', 'rephrase', 'ssplit', 'delete', 'delete', 'delete', 'delete', 'delete', 'delete', 'delete', 'delete', 'ssplit', 'rephrase', 'rephrase', 'rephrase', 'rephrase', 'rephrase', 'ssplit', 'delete', 'delete', 'delete', 'rephrase']",556,219,24,0.5
